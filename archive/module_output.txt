[STRUCTURAL RULES]
- Characters level up by accomplishing goals, not by killing monsters:

    • Escaping the house gains level 3.
- House repairs itself after destruction within 2d6 hours, restoring structure but not replacing removed items or destroyed undead.
- Illusory children Rose and Thorn appear outside to lure characters inside; vanish if attacked or forced inside.
- Ghosts of children appear if toys or dollhouse disturbed, can possess characters, can only be laid to rest if their skeletons are placed in family crypts (areas 23E, 23F).
- Secret stairs (area 21) only exist after house wills them or after finding Strahd’s letter or dollhouse secret door.
- Denying cult their sacrifice triggers worsening house defenses, animated dangers, and environmental hazards.

[NOTES]
- Players should be steered to this house via the "Creeping Fog" hook leading to the village of Barovia.
- The house is sentient and actively tries to trap visitors.
- The children and some other family members are dead, spirits and ghosts are active within.
- The cult’s actions centuries ago and Strahd’s arrival heavily influence the haunting and dangers.
- Characters can burn the house down but it reforms.
- Players may obtain many clues and treasures by exploration.
- The final encounter in the ritual chamber lets characters choose to appease or defy the cult, leading to greatly different consequences.
