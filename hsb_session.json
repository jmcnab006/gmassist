The salty breeze carries the faint cries of seabirds circling overhead and the distant lapping of gentle waves against the rocky shoreline below. Nearby, the shining white stone of a temple dedicated to Bahamut gleams softly in the daylight, its serene dragon statue watching over the tranquil gardens and simple monastic cells carved into the cliff face. Kobolds in simple garb move about with curious glances toward you, their voices a mix of cautious whispers and friendly greetings. The air here is fresh and tinged with sea salt, yet carries an undercurrent of unease\u2014as though the quiet peace might soon be shattered."

His long blonde beard sways gently, blue eyes half-lidded as if already yearning for a restful nap. He carries the quiet weight of a soldier-turned-cleric, his mind wandering even as he stands alert.\n\nAlongside him, a tall, lean figure with striking red and blonde hair catches the light. Her tanned skin and clear crystal silver eyes shimmer with warmth and curiosity beneath studded leather armor. The fighter moves with confident grace, a rapier and shield always ready\u2014a soldier heart eager for new stories and peaceful resolutions.\n\nA tall high-elf with pale blonde hair and a draped partial skeleton adds a spectral presence. His brooding gaze and cynical demeanor hint at darker aspirations nurtured in solitude, a wizard versed in necromantic arts who prefers finality over mercy.\n\nNext is a towering dragonborn, scales gleaming gold and black, purple claws flexing with subtle tension. A scar marks his cheek, betraying a shadowed past of thievery and deceit. The rogue slinks slightly at the edges, mistrust and opportunism written across every movement.\n\nA tall, calm ranger with elf-like grace carries a bow and twin scimitars, watching quietly. Patient and reserved, he has guided many through perilous lands and now observes this island with measured intent.\n\nTogether, you have journeyed to Stormwreck Isle by ship, storms lashing and waves thrashing as you navigated rocky coasts and sudden swells. The harbor\u2019s calm here is a welcome contrast to the tempestuous sea, but the weight of the island\u2019s mysteries settles immediately among you\u2014a dawning sense that adventure has only just begun."

    "You stand at the edge of Dragon's Rest, a small cloister perched on rugged cliffs that rise sharply above a calm, sheltered harbor. The salty breeze carries the faint cries of seabirds circling overhead and the distant lapping of gentle waves against the rocky shoreline below. Nearby, the shining white stone of a temple dedicated to Bahamut gleams softly in the daylight, its serene dragon statue watching over the tranquil gardens and simple monastic cells carved into the cliff face. Kobolds in simple garb move about with curious glances toward you, their voices a mix of cautious whispers and friendly greetings. The air here is fresh and tinged with sea salt, yet carries an undercurrent of unease\u2014as though the quiet peace might soon be shattered.",
    "A varied band of six stands before Dragon\u2019s Rest, each carved by story and purpose, drawn together by fate or fortune to this enigmatic island.\n\nA short, square-framed dwarf clad in chainmail shifts slightly in the sun. His long blonde beard sways gently, blue eyes half-lidded as if already yearning for a restful nap. He carries the quiet weight of a soldier-turned-cleric, his mind wandering even as he stands alert.\n\nAlongside him, a tall, lean figure with striking red and blonde hair catches the light. Her tanned skin and clear crystal silver eyes shimmer with warmth and curiosity beneath studded leather armor. The fighter moves with confident grace, a rapier and shield always ready\u2014a soldier heart eager for new stories and peaceful resolutions.\n\nA tall high-elf with pale blonde hair and a draped partial skeleton adds a spectral presence. His brooding gaze and cynical demeanor hint at darker aspirations nurtured in solitude, a wizard versed in necromantic arts who prefers finality over mercy.\n\nNext is a towering dragonborn, scales gleaming gold and black, purple claws flexing with subtle tension. A scar marks his cheek, betraying a shadowed past of thievery and deceit. The rogue slinks slightly at the edges, mistrust and opportunism written across every movement.\n\nA tall, calm ranger with elf-like grace carries a bow and twin scimitars, watching quietly. Patient and reserved, he has guided many through perilous lands and now observes this island with measured intent.\n\nTogether, you have journeyed to Stormwreck Isle by ship, storms lashing and waves thrashing as you navigated rocky coasts and sudden swells. The harbor\u2019s calm here is a welcome contrast to the tempestuous sea, but the weight of the island\u2019s mysteries settles immediately among you\u2014a dawning sense that adventure has only just begun.",
    "As you gather at the cloister\u2019s edge, the steady rhythm of the harbor settles around you. The distant cries of seabirds mix with the gentle splash of waves, yet beneath this calm lies a palpable tension\u2014a foreshadowing of challenges yet to unfold on this island. The kobolds glance your way with quiet curiosity, their wary eyes reflecting the island\u2019s fragile peace. The sun paints the white stone of the temple in warm light, but shadows flicker in the corners of Dragon\u2019s Rest, as if waiting for the story to truly begin.",
    "The salty air of Dragon\u2019s Rest feels a shade lighter now, the lingering shadow of the harpy\u2019s menace lifted with the talisman\u2019s burial. Kobold faces hold traces of grateful relief, and the kitchen hums quietly with preparations. The cook, a stocky kobold with soot-streaked hands and a weathered apron, catches your eye.\n\n\u201cAye, we could use some fresh mushrooms,\u201d he says, voice low but earnest. \u201cThe larder\u2019s running thin, and the myconids in Seagrow Caves might share if we bring a gift\u2014or solve their troubles.\u201d\n\nNearby, Tarak, the cloister\u2019s gardener, tends to a patch of hardy herbs with deliberate care. His eyes glance up as you approach, worn with years but steady and earnest.\n\n\u201cIf you speak with me,\" Tarak begins, \u201cI might have a task for you\u2014one that could help both the myconids and the island itself. It\u2019s not an easy path, but it\u2019s needed.\u201d His gaze sharpens, suggesting secrets beneath his calm exterior, ready to unfold should you choose to listen.",
    "You stand within Dragon\u2019s Rest, near the bustling kitchen and the quiet herb gardens where Tarak tends his plants. Around you, the simple white stone of the temple to Bahamut glows softly in the daylight, and kobolds move about, their tasks lightened by the recent lifting of the curse. The faint scent of sea salt mingles with the earthy aroma of fresh herbs, while the murmurs of the cloister\u2019s residents create a calm yet expectant atmosphere, as if the island itself waits for your next move.",
    "The cook wipes his hands on his apron and leans in slightly, lowering his voice with a conspiratorial tone. \u201cTarak\u2019s no ordinary gardener,\u201d he says, eyes flicking toward the herb gardens where the man tends his plants with quiet focus. \u201cHe knows the island\u2019s secrets better than most\u2014and he\u2019s got his ear to the ground about the troubles in those Seagrow Caves. If anyone can guide you through the fungal blight or find a way to help the myconids, it\u2019s him. Folk around here trust him, and if you want to keep helping the island, you\u2019d do well to speak with Tarak.\u201d His voice carries a note of hope, but also a warning: this task won\u2019t be easy.",
    "The kitchen bustles quietly with the warm glow of midday light filtering through narrow windows. The air is thick with the rich, earthy scents of simmering stews and fresh herbs, mingling with the faint tang of sea salt carried in from outside. The cook, a stocky kobold with soot-streaked hands and a weathered apron, stands near a wooden table cluttered with knives, baskets of root vegetables, and drying herbs. His eyes flick toward you with a mix of fatigue and guarded hope, the lines on his scaly face hinting at the weight of recent troubles lifted but far from forgotten. Around him, the gentle clatter of pots and murmurs of cloister residents create a steady rhythm\u2014a fragile calm in the heart of Dragon\u2019s Rest.",
    "The cook\u2019s eyes narrow thoughtfully as he leans on the worn wooden table, the faint scent of herbs clinging to his scales. \u201cTarak\u2019s the cloister\u2019s gardener\u2014quiet, steady, and sharp as a thorn,\u201d he says, voice low but sure. \u201cHe\u2019s not just tending plants; he knows the island\u2019s secrets, especially the troubles brewing deeper in the Seagrow Caves.\u201d \n\nHe gestures vaguely toward the southwest, where the cliffs slope toward shadowed fungal groves. \u201cThe myconids are mushroom folk\u2014fungal creatures who live in those caves. Usually peaceful, but lately they\u2019re sickened by some foul blight choking their home. Tarak\u2019s been trying to help, but the problem\u2019s grown worse, and they\u2019re desperate for aid.\u201d \n\nHis gaze meets yours steadily. \u201cIf you\u2019re willing to help, Tarak can guide you. But beware\u2014the caves are dangerous, and the sickness is spreading.\u201d",
    "The cook nods approvingly, a faint smile tugging at his lips. \u201cGood. The myconids and the caves won\u2019t wait forever, and neither does the larder.\u201d Nearby, Tarak straightens from his tending and looks toward you, his calm eyes reflecting a cautious hope. \u201cFollow me,\u201d he says quietly, turning toward the cloister\u2019s path that winds southward along the cliffs toward the shadowed fungal groves. The salty breeze carries the scent of damp earth and faint spores as the island seems to hold its breath, awaiting your next steps.",
    "The path southward from Dragon\u2019s Rest winds along rugged cliffs, where the salty sea breeze mingles with the damp, earthy scent of moss and decay. The trail narrows beneath twisted limbs of hardy coastal trees and patches of low, creeping fungus that glow faintly in the fading light. As you descend, the air grows cooler and heavier, faintly sweet yet tinged with an unsettling dampness. Somewhere ahead, the muted chorus of dripping water and the soft rustle of unseen creatures echo through shadowed groves of bioluminescent fungi. The ground beneath your feet shifts from firm stone to soft, spongy earth, and a subtle mist begins to rise\u2014clouds of spores that hang in the air, delicate but pervasive. Tarak moves steadily ahead, his figure blending with the dim, otherworldly glow as the entrance to the Seagrow Caves comes into view, framed by towering fungal growths that pulse gently with muted light.",
    "With a quick glance at the softly glowing fungi, your knowledge of nature hints at their general nature but offers little specific insight. The faint bioluminescence and unusual shapes suggest common cave-dwelling fungal species, but the deeper secrets\u2014the blighted spores or toxic varieties\u2014remain hidden beyond your immediate understanding. Something about these growths feels subtly wrong, yet your limited knowledge can\u2019t quite pin down the danger lurking within the glow.",
    "Nine\u2019s fingers close gently around a pulsating, bioluminescent mushroom, the soft glow casting eerie shadows on her pale skin as she carefully tucks it into an empty pouch. Nearby, Nova plucks a similar glowing fungus and, with a curious smile, bites into it. The faint sweetness and earthy tang mingle on her tongue, the warm glow of the mushroom briefly illuminating her face. Thorin\u2019s sharp blue eyes fix on Nova, watching intently for any sign of a reaction, his expression a mixture of suspicion and mild concern. Rilven stands a bit apart, arms crossed and brow furrowed, regarding the scene with a dry, measured gaze as if mentally cataloging the odd behavior unfolding before him. The gentle hum of spores in the air seems to pause, holding its breath along with the group.",
    "Nova feels a brief, mild tingling on her tongue but no lasting discomfort follows. The glowing mushroom\u2019s subtle effects seem harmless\u2014more curious than dangerous. She does not exhibit any signs of poisoning or ill condition, and her constitution holds strong against whatever faint spore magic the fungus carries.",
    "Nova feels a fleeting warmth spread briefly across her tongue, but no lasting sickness or weakness takes hold. The glowing mushroom\u2019s faint magical properties prove benign, producing no poison or harmful effect. Her constitution easily resists any subtle toxins or spores, leaving her unharmed and curious rather than ill.",
    "As Nine\u2019s chilling touch brushes against the glowing mushroom nestled in her pouch, a faint wispy frost briefly coats its surface, dimming its soft luminescence for a moment before the glow slowly returns. No visible harm comes to the fungus; it seems resilient to the cold touch. The mushroom remains intact, its eerie glow undiminished, as if unfazed by the spectral chill.",
    "You ascend a narrow stone staircase carved into the cavern wall, the air growing cooler and heavier with every step. Bioluminescent fungi cast an eerie, muted glow along the damp rock surfaces, their faint pulses lending a ghostly rhythm to the shadowed passage. The scent of earth and spores thickens, mingling with a subtle metallic tang that hints at minerals deeper within. At the top, the staircase opens into a wider cavern chamber where clusters of glowing mushrooms and thick fungal growth cling to the jagged walls and floor, the dim light revealing faint movements in the flickering shadows beyond.",
    "The cavern chamber spreads before you, its high ceiling lost in shadow, with walls draped in thick mats of bioluminescent fungi casting a soft, otherworldly light. Towering mushroom stalks of varying shapes and sizes rise from the damp earth, their caps glowing in hues of pale blue and green. The air is dense with moisture and a faint, sweet mustiness that hints at decay and life intertwined. Faint rustlings echo from the darker alcoves, where clusters of smaller fungal growths pulse gently like a slow heartbeat. The ground beneath your feet is soft and springy, carpeted with moss and delicate mycelium webs, with occasional patches of spores drifting lazily in the still, heavy air. A subtle sense of quiet watchfulness pervades the space\u2014as if unseen eyes observe your every move in this silent fungal cathedral.",
    "As Nine steps forward to probe a cluster of fungi, a ripple of movement stirs in the shadows nearby. From the dim corners of the chamber, three violet fungi emerge\u2014bulbous, mottled growths with writhing tendrils and glowing, ominous purple hues. They surge toward Nine with slow but relentless intent, their rot-tinged spores drifting in the air like a creeping haze.\n\nSuddenly, the quiet fungal cathedral erupts in hostile motion\u2014combat begins as the violet fungi lash out, their tendrils reaching to ensnare and infect. The chamber\u2019s eerie glow shifts to a battleground of survival.",
    "Here are the statistics for the Violet Fungus, adapted for your encounter:\n\n---\n\n**Violet Fungus**  \n*Medium plant, unaligned*\n\n**Armor Class:** 5  \n**Hit Points:** 22 (5d8)  \n**Speed:** 5 ft., climb 5 ft.\n\n**STR** 15 (+2) | **DEX** 1 (-5) | **CON** 10 (+0) | **INT** 1 (-5) | **WIS** 3 (-4) | **CHA** 1 (-5)\n\n**Damage Immunities:** poison  \n**Condition Immunities:** blinded, deafened, frightened, prone  \n**Senses:** blindsight 30 ft.

The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.\n\n---\n\nThese creatures move slowly but are tenacious, lashing out with their tendrils to ensnare and drain vitality. The spores they emit make their attacks particularly dangerous.\n\nIf you need adjustments for party level or additional effects, just ask!",
    "The violet fungi\u2019s twisted tendrils lash out with sluggish determination. One reaches toward Nova, aiming to ensnare her arm with a grasping grip of decay. Another slithers its foul limbs toward Rilven, trying to envelop his torso in choking rot. The third lashes out at Nine, attempting to sink its tendrils into her and poison her with necrotic spores. The chamber fills with the heavy scent of mildew and the unsettling hiss of spores releasing into the damp air\u2014danger closing in fast. Combat has begun.",
    "The violet fungi\u2019s mottled tendrils writhe forward with eerie intent. One lashes toward Nine, seeking to inject her with their necrotic spores. Another swings sluggishly at Thorin, aiming to overwhelm him with rot and decay. The third tendril strikes toward Fenwick, creeping claws stretching to ensnare and poison. The damp air thickens with the sickly-sweet scent of mildew as the fungi close in\u2014combat erupts in the glowing cavern.",
    "The fungi\u2019s twisted tendrils lash out fiercely\u2014Thorin grimaces as one coils around him, its rotten grip sinking in and spreading a sickly numbness through his veins; his skin pales, the poison taking hold. Nine feels a sharp, searing sting as tendrils lash across her skin, but she resists the toxin\u2019s grasp, shaking off the worst of its venomous bite. \n\nYour retaliatory strikes slash and crack against the fungi\u2019s mottled forms, the creatures recoiling as one sustains a deep wound, oozing dark ichor where your weapons and spells landed true. The chamber\u2019s eerie glow flickers with tension\u2014this battle is far from over.",
    "A twisted tendril lashes out toward Rilven with unnatural precision, catching him off guard. The fungal limb wraps swiftly around his torso, squeezing with brutal force as barbed growths rake across his skin. A sickening crack echoes as the rogue delivers a crushing blow, leaving deep tears and oozing dark ichor trailing from the wounds. Pain radiates sharply through Rilven\u2019s body, the vile rot seeping into his flesh, threatening to sap his strength and steady hand. The cavern seems to hold its breath as the fungal menace tightens its grip\u2014this strike has struck true and viciously.",
    "A warm, steady glow radiates from Thorin\u2019s hands as healing energy flows into Rilven, knitting torn flesh and easing the painful rot beneath his skin. Color returns to Rilven\u2019s face, his breath steadies, and his eyes sharpen with renewed focus. Seizing the moment, Rilven lunges at a weakened violet fungus nearby, his blade flashing through the dim light. The tendrils recoil as the mushroom\u2019s form collapses with a sickening squelch, its dark ichor pooling on the damp cavern floor. One fungal threat is vanquished, but two still loom, restless and dangerous.",
    "With a determined cry, Rilven lunges forward, his scimitar flashing in the dim fungal light. His blade slices clean through thick, writhing tendrils, cutting deep into the final violet fungus. The creature shudders violently, its glowing purple form flickering erratically as dark ichor spurts from the wound. With a guttural, wet crack, the fungal mass collapses inward, shrinking rapidly until it withers into a dark, lifeless husk. The heavy scent of mildew and decay begins to fade, replaced by a fragile stillness. The cavern feels less oppressive now, the soft glow of the remaining fungi steady and calm, as if the silent watchers in the shadows briefly exhale in relief.",
    "Nine\u2019s sharp eyes sweep over the remains of the fallen violet fungi and the surrounding mushrooms, noting subtle details others might miss. With careful scrutiny, she identifies telltale signs of corruption\u2014the blight\u2019s necrotic rot has twisted these fungi beyond normal decay, their spores seething with harmful magic. Nearby, faint mycelial threads pulse weakly, suggesting that the infection spreads through these fungal networks like a dark, creeping poison. Her practiced gaze glimpses potential flaws in the blight\u2019s hold\u2014a chance to disrupt the spread if approached wisely. This insight could prove crucial for healing the myconid colony deeper within the caves.",
    "Nova lowers herself onto the soft, spongy fungal ground, the gentle give cushioning her as she settles in. The faint glow of bioluminescent fungi bathes her in pale light, and the damp, earthy scent surrounds her like a quiet sanctuary as she begins to rest, breathing steady and calm.\n\nNearby, Nine kneels beside Rilven, producing a healer\u2019s kit with practiced hands. She cleanses his wounds with careful precision, applying salves and bandages that ease the lingering effects of the poison. Slowly, life returns to color in his cheeks, and his breath steadies\u2014the toxins retreating beneath her skillful ministrations. The cave feels momentarily less hostile as recovery begins amidst shadows and glowing growths.",
    "Nine moves carefully among the glowing fungi, her fingers deftly harvesting four heart cap mushrooms\u2014plump, bulbous fungi with deep crimson caps that pulse faintly with life. Each mushroom feels cool and slightly damp to the touch, their delicate stems releasing a faint earthy aroma as she tucks them securely into her pack. The soft glow of the cavern bathes the harvest in an eerie light, promising potential healing or alchemical use as the party prepares to press deeper into the caves.",
    "As you approach the heart of the cavern, faint shapes begin to stir ahead\u2014bulbous, pale figures shrouded in shifting mycelium caps and delicate tendrils. The myconids move with urgent purpose, their spongy forms bobbing and swaying as they hasten to shepherd timid fungal sprouts deeper into the next chamber. Silent yet purposeful, their every movement speaks of a desperate need to protect their kin from a lurking threat. The damp, heavy air is thick with the scent of earth and spores, punctuated by the soft rustle of fungal limbs brushing against stone. The colony\u2019s quiet urgency hangs palpable, inviting caution\u2014and attention\u2014to whatever peril drives their haste.",
    "The myconids communicate primarily through subtle bioluminescent pulses along their caps and gentle movements of their tendrils, creating a silent, rhythmic language of light and gesture. They also release delicate clouds of spores carrying chemical signals that convey emotions and intentions to nearby colony members. Together, these methods foster a deep, communal understanding rather than spoken words\u2014a harmonious exchange of thoughts and feelings shared among the fungal folk.",
    "The myconids release delicate clouds of pale, shimmering spores known as rapport spores. These spores drift softly through the air in faint, luminescent wisps that catch the dim light of the cavern. When inhaled, the spores induce a gentle empathic connection, allowing minds to share emotions, simple thoughts, and intentions without words. The effect is calming and subtle\u2014feelings of trust and understanding ripple between those touched by the spores, smoothing tension and fostering peaceful communication. This silent, fragrant link binds the myconid colony together, transforming shared moods and ideas into a communal harmony that transcends language.",
    "You follow the myconids deeper into the caves, the passage widening as you enter a vast chamber draped in thick fungal curtains and glowing spores. This Circle Chamber is dominated by a large ring of smooth stone embedded in the earthen floor, surrounded by towering mushroom stalks whose caps shimmer with soft, pulsing light. The air here feels denser\u2014laden with spores that drift lazily in gentle currents\u2014and carries a faint hum, as if the very walls resonate with quiet, ancient energy. The myconids pause, their bioluminescent caps flickering in a steady rhythm, suggesting vigilance and unease, as if guarding this sacred space from some unseen threat.",
    "Your sharp eyes catch subtle but disturbing signs among the myconids\u2019 delicate forms. Their usually vibrant caps bear faint discolorations\u2014patches of dull gray and sickly brown that disrupt their gentle glow. Some myconids move sluggishly, their tendrils drooping with weakness, while others emit thin trails of dark spores that linger longer and heavier than normal. The air around them feels thicker, heavy with a faint, acrid tang that hints at decay. These telltale signs reveal the blight\u2019s cruel grip tightening on the colony\u2014a creeping corruption sapping their life and threatening to spread deeper into the caves.",
    "The myconids respond with gentle pulses of light from their caps, their tendrils swaying in rhythmic patterns. Though words are absent, the empathic connection from their rapport spores conveys a clear message: the source of their suffering lies deeper within the caves, near a blocked vent that stifles vital volcanic fumes. They \u201curge\u201d you toward that direction\u2014a shadowed passage veiled in thick fungal growths\u2014indicating that clearing the vent might restore the flow of air and ease the blight choking their home. Their silent plea carries both hope and urgency, an invitation to heal their underground sanctuary.",
    "You leave the Circle Chamber behind, following the myconids\u2019 silent guidance as the tunnel narrows and slopes downward. The air grows warmer and tinged with a faint sulfurous tang, mingling with the earthy scent of damp stone and fungus. Eventually, the cavern opens into a crystalline grotto where glimmering orange fire crystals jut from the walls and ceiling, casting flickering, fiery reflections across the rough cavern floor. The glow casts strange shadows among clusters of fungal growths, and the distant rumble of trapped volcanic fumes echoes faintly through the chamber, hinting at the vital energy held captive within this hidden heart of the caves.",
    "The cavern\u2019s warm glow reveals clusters of vivid fungal growths sprawling across the rocky floor, their colors muted beneath the fiery reflections of the orange crystals. The air hangs heavy with a mixture of damp earth and faint sulfur, a subtle vibration trembling beneath your feet. Ahead, a narrow fissure in the cavern wall pulses with trapped energy, its opening choked by thick mineral deposits and twisted fungal tendrils woven tightly like a natural barrier. The faint rumble of volcanic breath lies just beyond, muffled and restless\u2014a stifled life force yearning to break free. The oppressive stillness here weighs against your senses, urging caution as you approach the heart of the blight.",
    "From the shadows near the crystalline walls, several fume drakes stir\u2014sinister, serpentine creatures adapted to these toxic caverns. Their scales shimmer with an oily sheen, and faint wisps of noxious smoke curl from their maws as their eyes glint with predatory intent.\n\n---\n\n**Fume Drake**  \n*Medium dragon, unaligned*\n\n**Armor Class:** 14 (natural armor)  \n**Hit Points:** 45 (6d8 + 18)  \n**Speed:** 30 ft., climb 30 ft.\n\n**STR** 16 (+3) | **DEX** 14 (+2) | **CON** 16 (+3) | **INT** 5 (-3) | **WIS** 12 (+1) | **CHA** 7 (-2)\n\n**Saving Throws:** Dex +4, Con +5  \n**Damage Immunities:** poison  \n**Condition Immunities:** poisoned  \n**Senses:** darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 11  \n**Languages:** \u2014  \n**Challenge:** 2 (450 XP)\n\n**Actions:**\n\n**Multiattack.** The fume drake makes two attacks: one bite and one tail attack.\n\n**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.  \n*Hit:* 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) poison damage.\n\n**Tail.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.  \n*Hit:* 8 (1d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage.\n\n**Poisonous Breath (Recharge 5\u20136).** The fume drake exhales a cloud of choking fumes in a 15-foot cone.

    "Emerging from the shadows near the crystalline walls, the fume drakes slither with unsettling grace. Their sinuous bodies glisten with slick, oily scales that shimmer darkly in the flickering firelight, blotches of muted gray and sickly green blending into the cavern\u2019s damp surroundings. Wisps of noxious smoke curl continuously from their open maws, curling upward in thin, choking spirals that scent the air with a sharp, acrid tang. Their glowing eyes gleam with cold, predatory intelligence, watching your every move as their serpentine tails coil and flex with lethal readiness. These creatures exude a palpable menace, adapted perfectly to this toxic lair\u2014silent hunters waiting for the moment to strike.",
    "The small elemental fume drakes lurking in the crystalline grotto are quick and venomous, perfectly adapted to this toxic environment.\n\n---\n\n**Fume Drake**  \n*Small elemental, unaligned*\n\n**Armor Class:** 14 (natural armor)  \n**Hit Points:** 27 (6d6 + 6)  \n**Speed:** 30 ft., climb 30 ft.\n\n**STR** 10 (+0) | **DEX** 16 (+3) | **CON** 13 (+1) | **INT** 6 (-2) | **WIS** 12 (+1) | **CHA** 7 (-2)\n\n**Saving Throws:** Dex +5, Con +3  \n**Damage Immunities:** poison  \n**Condition Immunities:** poisoned  \n**Senses:** darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 11  \n**Languages:** \u2014  \n**Challenge:** 1 (200 XP)\n\n**Actions:**\n\n**Multiattack.** The fume drake makes two attacks: one bite and one tail attack.\n\n**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.  \n*Hit:* 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage plus 5 (1d10) poison damage.\n\n**Tail.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.  \n*Hit:* 5 (1d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage.\n\n**Poisonous Breath (Recharge 5\u20136).** The fume drake exhales a cloud of choking fumes in a 10-foot cone.
