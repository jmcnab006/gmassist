The salty breeze carries the faint cries of seabirds circling overhead and the distant lapping of gentle waves against the rocky shoreline below. Nearby, the shining white stone of a temple dedicated to Bahamut gleams softly in the daylight, its serene dragon statue watching over the tranquil gardens and simple monastic cells carved into the cliff face. Kobolds in simple garb move about with curious glances toward you, their voices a mix of cautious whispers and friendly greetings. The air here is fresh and tinged with sea salt, yet carries an undercurrent of unease\u2014as though the quiet peace might soon be shattered."

His long blonde beard sways gently, blue eyes half-lidded as if already yearning for a restful nap. He carries the quiet weight of a soldier-turned-cleric, his mind wandering even as he stands alert.\n\nAlongside him, a tall, lean figure with striking red and blonde hair catches the light. Her tanned skin and clear crystal silver eyes shimmer with warmth and curiosity beneath studded leather armor. The fighter moves with confident grace, a rapier and shield always ready\u2014a soldier heart eager for new stories and peaceful resolutions.\n\nA tall high-elf with pale blonde hair and a draped partial skeleton adds a spectral presence. His brooding gaze and cynical demeanor hint at darker aspirations nurtured in solitude, a wizard versed in necromantic arts who prefers finality over mercy.\n\nNext is a towering dragonborn, scales gleaming gold and black, purple claws flexing with subtle tension. A scar marks his cheek, betraying a shadowed past of thievery and deceit. The rogue slinks slightly at the edges, mistrust and opportunism written across every movement.\n\nA tall, calm ranger with elf-like grace carries a bow and twin scimitars, watching quietly. Patient and reserved, he has guided many through perilous lands and now observes this island with measured intent.\n\nTogether, you have journeyed to Stormwreck Isle by ship, storms lashing and waves thrashing as you navigated rocky coasts and sudden swells. The harbor\u2019s calm here is a welcome contrast to the tempestuous sea, but the weight of the island\u2019s mysteries settles immediately among you\u2014a dawning sense that adventure has only just begun."
