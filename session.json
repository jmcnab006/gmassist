Ahead lies a gravel road that winds its way into a cluster of dark, towering houses resembling tombstones, their windows shuttered and doors tightly closed. The village feels heavy with silence, the air thick with an unsettling stillness that presses down on your senses. Two small children, pale and visibly distressed, stand at the edge of the road, their eyes fixed on you as they whisper urgently about a \"monster\" lurking nearby."
