The air buzzes with tension beneath the genial atmosphere\u2014as if a storm brews just beyond the inn\u2019s walls.\n\nBuhrell rises and approaches, his voice low but firm. \"Just act normal, but listen closely. Everyone's life might be in danger.\" His gaze sweeps the room, careful not to draw undue attention. \"A dangerous magical item has surfaced here tonight\u2014one that the Cult of the Dragon would kill to find. I need your help to keep it out of their hands.\"\n\nAround you, the halfling staff busily attend to patrons, and an elf named Surruk nods silently from a corner, his rare bow resting against the table. Nearby, elderly women whisper rumors and gossip, their eyes flicking toward the newcomers.\n\nWhat do you do?"

Among the lively tables and bustling halfling waitstaff, a faint glimmer of enchanted energy catches his eye: a soft, pulsating glow lingering around a finely crafted necklace resting near one of the tables. The light is subtle but unmistakable\u2014a magic item concealed within this sea of chatter and steam.\n\nBuhrell, noticing Garrick's expression, leans in slightly. \"That might be what we're after.
