[AREA:1A]
name: Portico Entrance
description: A wrought-iron gate fills the archway of a stone portico, its rusty hinges shrieking when opened. Oil lamps hang from the ceiling by chains, flanking a set of oaken doors that lead into the grand foyer. The gate is unlocked but weathered by time. The portico serves as the threshold to the haunted Death House, standing between the outside mists and the dark interior. The houses on either side are abandoned, their windows and doors boarded up, emphasizing the isolation of this location.

description: Upon entering through the oaken doors, the grand foyer reveals a spacious area with a shield emblazoned with a golden windmill on a red field hanging on the south wall. Flanking the shield are framed portraits of long-dead Durst family aristocrats, their stony faces watching silently.

description: This wide hall spans the width of the house, dominated at one end by a black marble fireplace and at the other by a sweeping red marble staircase that ascends to the second floor. Above the fireplace hangs a nonmagical longsword with a windmill cameo worked into its hilt. The wood-paneled walls are ornately sculpted with images of vines, flowers, nymphs, and satyrs. A successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals serpents and skulls subtly woven into the paneling, hinting at the house’s sinister nature. The staircase curves upward, its banister following the intricate paneling.

description: This oak-paneled room resembles a hunter’s den, with a stag’s head mounted above the fireplace. Around the room are three stuffed wolves positioned as if frozen in mid-motion. Two padded chairs draped in animal furs face the hearth, with an oak table between them supporting a cask of wine, two carved wooden goblets, and a pipe. The room feels like a preserved moment in time, a macabre tribute to hunting and death.

A crystal chandelier hangs above the table, which is covered with resplendent silverware and crystalware polished to a dazzling shine. Mounted above the marble fireplace is a mahogany-framed painting of an alpine vale. The wall paneling is intricately carved with images of deer among the trees, and with a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check, characters can discern twisted faces carved into the tree trunks and wolves lurking amid the foliage. Red silk drapes cover the windows, and a tapestry depicting hunting dogs and horse-mounted aristocrats chasing a wolf hangs from an iron rod bolted to the south wall. The silverware tarnishes, the crystal cracks, the portrait fades, and the tapestry rots if removed from the house.

A worktable holds a cutting board and rolling pin, while a stone, dome-shaped oven stands near the east wall, its bent iron stovepipe connecting to a hole in the ceiling. A thin door behind the stove leads to the well-stocked pantry (area 4B). A dumbwaiter is hidden behind a small door in the southwest corner—a 2-foot-wide stone shaft containing a wooden elevator box attached to a manual rope-and-pulley mechanism.

description: The master of the house once spent many hours in this room, which features red velvet drapes covering the windows. An exquisite mahogany desk and matching high-back chair face the entrance and fireplace, above which hangs a framed picture of a windmill perched atop a rocky crag. Two overstuffed chairs occupy the corners, and floor-to-ceiling bookshelves line the south wall, accessible via a rolling wooden ladder. The desk holds an oil lamp, jar of ink, quill pen, tinderbox, and a letter kit containing a red wax candle, four blank sheets of parchment, and a wooden seal bearing the Durst family’s windmill insignia. The desk drawer contains an iron key that unlocks the door to area 20.

[AREA:9]
name: Secret Room
description: This hidden room contains bookshelves packed with tomes describing fiend-summoning and necromantic rituals of the Priests of Osybus cult. The rituals are bogus, ascertainable after 1 hour of study and a DC 12 Intelligence (Arcana) check. A heavy wooden chest with clawed iron feet stands against the south wall, its lid half-closed. A skeleton in leather armor lies partially inside, pierced by three poisoned darts that caused its death; the dart trap no longer functions. Clutched in the skeleton’s left hand is a letter sealed by Strahd von Zarovich, containing a scornful message to the cultists. The chest holds three blank black leather books (worth 25 gp each), three spell scrolls (bless, protection from poison, spiritual weapon), the deed to the house, the deed to a windmill east of Vallaki, and a signed will bequeathing the property to Rosavalda and Thornboldt Durst.

This suit of animated armor attacks as soon as it takes damage or a character approaches within 5 feet and fights until destroyed. Oil lamps are mounted on oak-paneled walls carved with woodland scenes of trees, falling leaves, and tiny critters. Characters who search the walls for secret doors or inspect the paneling can, with a DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check, notice tiny corpses hanging from the trees and worms bursting from the ground.

Two small skeletons wearing tattered but recognizable clothing lie in the middle of the floor; the smaller skeleton cradles a stuffed doll. The toy chest contains assorted stuffed animals and toys.

[AREA:21]
name: Secret Stairs
description: A narrow spiral staircase made of creaky wood contained within a 5-foot-wide shaft of mortared stone. The shaft is filled with thick cobwebs reducing visibility to 5 feet. The staircase descends 50 feet from the attic to the dungeon level, passing through the lower levels of the house.

[AREA:36]
name: Prison
description: This grim chamber once held prisoners shackled to the back walls of alcoves. The prisoners are long gone, their bones scattered in area 27, but the rusty shackles remain as a haunting reminder. A secret door in the south wall, discoverable with a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, leads to area 38.

Smooth masonry walls provide excellent acoustics, supported by featureless stone pillars. A breach in the west wall leads to a dark cave filled with refuse. Murky water covers most of the floor, with dry stone ledges and a central octagonal dais rising above the water. Rusty chains with shackles hang from the ceiling above a bloodstained stone altar carved with grasping ghouls. A wooden wheel embedded in the east wall controls the nearby portcullis (area 37). The refuse pile conceals a shambling mound named Lorghoth the Decayer, asleep but dangerous if disturbed.
