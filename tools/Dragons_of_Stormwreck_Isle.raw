This set gives you and up to five of your friends everything you need-besides your imagination and a pencil­to journey in one of those worlds. WHA T' S  I N  TH I S   SET This set includes the following components: Rulebook. This rulebook contains all the rules you need to start playing D&D. Adventure Booklet. The other booklet in this set contains an adventure for you to play. Only the person who's going to run the adventure should read that booklet. Character Sheets. Five different characters-a cleric, a fighter, a paladin, a rogue, and a wizard­are provided for up to five players to  choose from. The characters that your group choose will go on the adventure in the adventure booklet. Dice. All the dice you need to play are included. GETTING  STAR TED I f  this i s  your first time playing D&D,  start b y  read­ing the rest of this introduction and chapter 1. They tell you the most important rules for play. V isit dnd.wizards.com/starter for additional guidance. The next step is to decide who is going to run the adventure-that person is called the Dungeon Mas­ter or DM-and who's going to play the adventurers. BEING A  PLAYER Each player chooses a character, an adventurer who teams up with the other players' adventurers. This set comes with several characters to choose from, each one printed on their own sheet. Take a look at each of the sheets, and choose the character who looks the most fun to play. Whichever characters you and the other players choose, the characters are assumed to be allies as they face the dangers of D&D together. The DM presents exciting chal­lenges, new friends, and handsome rewards to your characters. The DM is not your foe but does present dangers that provide opportunities for your adven­turers to shine and then thrive. The adventure in this set works best for four or five characters, so if you have fewer than four play­ers, we recommend some of you play more than one character. WELCOME  TO  DUNGEONS  &  DRAGONS BEING T H E   DM Instead of choosing a character, one participant takes on the role of the DM, the game's lead story­teller and referee. The DM runs the adventure for the characters, who navigate its hazards and decide which paths to explore. The DM describes the loca­tions and creatures that the adventurers face, and the players decide what they want their characters to do. Then the DM, using imagination and the game's rules, determines the results of the adven­turers'  actions and narrates what they experience. Because the DM can improvise to react to anything the players attempt, D&D is infinitely flexible. If you decide to be the DM, make sure to famil­iarize yourself with this rulebook, and read the ad­venture booklet. You'll then be ready to gather your friends together to play. RHYTHM  OF  P LAY Once the DM is ready  to run the adventure and the players have chosen their characters, the group gathers for a session of play. In a typical D&D ses­sion, play unfolds in encounters-similar to how a movie comprises scenes-and in each encounter, there are chances for the DM to describe creatures and places and for characters to make choices. Here's an example of the start of an encounter: Dungeon Master  (OM): A c r u m b l i n g  castle sta n d s  among the trees, the r u i n s  of seven towers j utti ng u p  from  it l ike broken teeth .  A n  a rchway l ittered with rusted  m etal gapes open at the top of a  s hort fl ight of steps. just i nside that openi ng, you spot two skeletal guards with glowing red eyes. Phillip (playing  Nica, the cleric):  Let's send the rogue up a h ead to look in  and  see if there are m o re than two guards. Amy (playing Diana, the rogue): OK, I ' l l  s neak u p  u nt i l  I  can peer i n  through t h e  entran ce. OM: All right, let's see how sneaky you are. Make a Dexterity check. Amy: Usi n g  my Stealth p roficiency,  right? OM: You  bet. Amy (rolling a d20):  D i a n a's p retty s neaky­that's a  17. OM: There's no  sign  the skel etal guard s  s pot you, and you d on't notice any others. GAM E  D IC E  The game uses dice with different numbers of sides. In these rules, the different dice are referred to by the letter d followed by the number of sides: d4, d6, d8,  dlO (with 0 standing for 10), dl2, and d20. For instance, a d6 is a six-sided die. When you need to roll dice, the rules tell you how many dice to roll of a certain type, as well as what modifiers ( positive or negative) to add. For example, "3d8 + 5" means you roll an eight-sided die three times, add the rolls together, and add 5 to the total. Percentile dice, or dlOO, work differently. You generate a number between 1 and 100 by rolling a ten-sided die twice. The first roll gives the tens digit, and the second roll gives the ones digit. For exam­ple, if you roll a 7 and a  1, the number rolled is 7 1, and if you roll a 0 and a 5,  the number rolled is 5. Two Os represent  100. T ERM S  TO  R EM EMB ER adventure.

If you'd  l ike to delve deeper i nto  D&D,  check out the fifth edition Player's Handbook,  Monster Manual,  and Dungeon Master's  Guide. These advanced rulebooks introduce you to the vast m u ltiverse of D&D and  i nvite you to create characters  and worlds wit h i n  it. WE LCOME TO  DUNGEONS  &  DRAGONS In that example, three main steps are present, and those steps occur in every D&D encounter, whether it's a peaceful encounter or a fight: 1: The DM  describes the environment. The DM tells the players where their adventurers are and what's around them, presenting the basic scope of options (how many doors lead out of a room, what's on a table, who's in the tavern, and so on). 2: The players decide what their characters do. A character's sheet contains various things that the character can do. When deciding what your character does, you may choose something on the sheet, or you may make something up. What­ever you decide, describe the intended action to the DM  and the other players. Sometimes all the characters do the same thing, and other times, different adventurers do different things; one adventurer might search a treasure chest while a second examines a symbol engraved on a wall, for example. Outside combat, the characters don't need to take turns, but the DM listens to every player and decides how to resolve those actions. In combat, everyone takes turns in order, as ex­plained in the "Combat" section (page 9). Ei-ther way, the DM tells you what happens next. 3: The DM narrates the results of the action. Sometimes, resolving a task is easy. If an adven­turer wants to walk across a room and open a door, the DM might just say that the door opens and describe what lies beyond. But the door might be locked, the floor might hide a deadly trap,  or some other circumstance might make it challenging for an adventurer to complete a task. In those cases, the DM checks to see if there are relevant rules-on a character sheet, in this rule­book, or in the adventure-and then decides what happ ens, often relying on the roll of a die to deter­mine the results of an action.  Describing the re­sults often leads to another decision point, which brings the flow of the game right back to step  1. CHAPTER  1PLAYING THE  GAME Turs CHAPTER PRESENTS  THE MAIN  RULES  OF PLAY. Many of the rules refer to six abilities (described be­low) possessed by every character and monster. You use these abilities in many different situations,  in­cluding combat,  social interaction, and exploration­the rules for which are presented in this chapter. Six AB I LITI E SSix abilities briefly describe a creature's physical and mental characteristics. These abilities appear on an adventurer's character sheet and in a mon­ster's stat block: Strength, measuring physical power Dexterity,  measuring agility, reflexes, and balance Constitution,  measuring endurance Intelligence,  measuring reasoning and memory Wisdom, measuring perceptiveness and intuition Charisma, measuring force of personality Each ability has a score, ranging from 3 tCi  18 for most adventurers. The highest a character's score can reach is 20.  Monsters can have scores as low as 1  or as high as 30. An ability score's most important function is pro­viding an ability modifier-a positive or negative number added to  ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls, as explained in the rest of this chapter. The Ability Scores and Modifiers table shows the modifier that each score provides. C H A PTER 1  I  PLAY ING  TH E  GAMEABI LITY  S C O R ES  A N D  MOD I F I E R S  Score Modifier 2-3 4 -5 6 -7 8 -9 10-11 12-13 14 -15 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 +O +l +2 Score 16-17 18-19 20-21 22-23 24 -25 26 -27 28 -29 30 Modifier +3 +4 +5 +6 +7 +8 +9 +10 TH E  D20  R O LL When the outcome of an action is uncertain, the game relies on a d20 roll to determine success or failure. Ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls are the three main kinds of d20 rolls, and whenever you make one, the roll is associated with one of the six abilities. The roll follows these steps: 1: Roll a d20,  and add the relevant ability modifier. The rest of this rulebook specifies which ability modifier to use for different types of d20 rolls. 2: Add your proficiency bonus if relevant. Each character has a proficiency bonus, a number you add when making a d20  roll that uses something in which your character has proficiency. See the "Proficiencies" section for more information. 3: Apply circumstantial bonuses and penalties. A class feature, a spell, or another rule might give a bonus or a penalty to the roll. Also, the roll might have advantage or disadvantage, explained in the "Advantage & Disadvantage" section. 4: Compare the total to a target number.  If the total of the d20 roll and its modifiers equals or ex­ceeds the target number,  the ability check, attack roll, or saving throw is a success.  Otherwise,  it's a failure. The DM determines target numbers and tells players whether their rolls are successful. The target number for an ability check or a saving throw is called a Difficulty Class ( DC). The most common DCs for ability checks are in the Typical Difficulty Classes table. The target number for an attack roll is called Armor Class (AC), which ap­pears on a character sheet or in a stat block. TY P I CAL  DI FFIC U LTY  ( L A S SES \ Task  Difficulty DC Task Difficulty Very easy Easy M ed i u m  5 10 15 H a rd Very h ard N early i m possi b l e  DC 20 25 3 0  PR OFIC I EN C IE SA character sheet notes the things that the character is especially good at, which are known as the char­acter's proficiencies. Here are the main proficien­cies, along with page references to their rules: Ski l l s  (page 6) Eq u i p ment (page 18) Savi ng Throws  ( page 7) USI NG YOUR PROFICI E N CY  B O N U S  Whenever you make a n  ability check, a saving throw, or an attack roll that uses one of your char­acter's proficiencies, you add the character's profi­ciency bonus to the roll. The bonus appears on your character sheet, and this rulebook and the character sheet tell you when the bonus applies. A monster's proficiency bonus is already incorpo­rated in the relevant numbers in the creature's stat block, so the DM doesn't need to add it. THE  B O N U S  D OE S N'T STAC K Your proficiency bonus can't be added to a die roll or other number more than once. For example, if two rules tell you to add your proficiency bonus to a Wisdom saving throw, you nevertheless add it only once to the save. Occasionally, a proficiency bonus might be multi­plied or divided (round down) before being added. For example, the rogue's Expertise feature doubles the proficiency bonus for certain ability checks. Whenever used, the bonus can be multiplied only once,  divided only once, and added only once. A DVAN TA GE  & D ISA DVAN TA GE Sometimes a rule, such as a class feature or a spell, says you have advantage or disadvantage on an ability check, a saving throw, or an attack roll. When that happens, roll the d20 twice when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17  and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advan­tage and roll those numbers, you use the 17. THEY  D ON'T  STACK If multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants advantage or imposes disadvantage on it, you don't roll the d20 more than one additional time. If two favorable situations grant advantage, for exam­ple, you still roll only one additional time. If circumstances cause a roll to have both advan­tage and disadvantage, you are considered to have neither of them, and you roll the d20  once.  This is true  even if multiple circumstances impose disad­vantage and only one grants advantage or vice versa. In such a situation, you have neither advantage nor disadvantage. I NTERACTI O N S  WITH  R E ROLLS When you have advantage or disadvantage and something in the game, such as the halfling's Lucky trait, lets you reroll or replace the d20, you can reroll or replace only one of the rolls. You choose which one. For example, if a halfling has advantage or disadvantage on an ability check and rolls a  1 and a  13, the halfling could use the Lucky trait to reroll the 1. AB I LITY  CH E CK SAn ability check tests a character's or monster's innate talent and training in an effort to overcome a challenge. The DM calls for an ability check when a character or monster attempts an action (other than an attack) that has a chance of failure. When the out­come is uncertain, the dice determine the results. MAKI NG  AN ABI LITY  C H E C K  Here are the steps for making an ability check: 1: Determine the ability to use. For every ability check, the DM decides which of the six abilities is relevant to the task at hand. This rulebook or the adventure booklet often tells the DM what kind of check a character can make and what happens if the check succeeds or fails.  Since characters of­ten try unpredictable things, the adventure book­let also provides advice to help the DM decide what kind of ability check to use in a situation. 2: Choose a skill that applies, if any. Each ability, except Constitution, has skills associated with it, and the rules or the DM determines which of those skills is relevant to a check. See the "Skills" section below for more information. 3: Set the Difficulty Class. Each ability check re­quires a DC, representing the difficulty of the task. The more difficult a task, the higher its DC. This rulebook, the adventure booklet, and the character sheets provide guidance on what the DC should be for certain checks. 4: Roll the  d20.  Then add the relevant ability mod­ifier, and if the check uses one of the character's skill proficiencies, add the character's proficiency bonus too. As with other d20 rolls, apply any bonuses and penalties, and compare the total to the DC. If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the ability check is a success. Otherwise, it's a failure, which means the character or monster makes no progress toward the objective or makes progress combined with a setback determined by the DM. S KI L L S  Each of the six abilities covers a range of capabili­ties, including skills that a character or a monster can be proficient in. A skill represents a specific aspect of an ability score, and an individual's profi­ciency in a skill demonstrates a focus on that aspect. The character sheets indicate each character's skill proficiencies, and a monster's skill proficiencies ap­pear in the monster's stat block. For example, a Dexterity check might reflect a character's attempt to pull off an acrobatic stunt, to palm an object, or to stay hidden. Each of these aspects of Dexterity has an associated skill: Acro­batics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth, respectively. So a character who has proficiency in the Stealth skill is particularly good at Dexterity checks related to sneaking and hiding. How TO U S E  SKILL P ROFICIENCIES Sometimes, the DM might ask for an ability check using a specific skill-for example, "Make a Wisdom ( Insight) check." At other times, a player might ask the DM if proficiency in a particular skill applies to a check. In either case, proficiency in a skill means an individual can add their proficiency bonus to ability checks that involve that skill. Without proficiency in the skill, the individual still makes the ability check but without adding their proficiency bonus. For example, if a character attempts to climb up a dangerous cliff, the Dungeon Master might ask for a Strength (Athletics) check. If the character is proficient in Athletics, the character's profi­ciency bonus is added to the Strength check. If the character lacks that proficiency, they just make a Strength check. SKILL LIST The skills related to each ability score are shown on the Skills table (no skills are related to Constitu­tion). That table also notes example uses for each skill proficiency.

The character who's leading the effort-or the one with the highest ability modifier­can make an ability check with advantage, reflecting the help provided by the other characters. In com­bat, this requires the Help action (page 12). A character can provide help only if the task is one they could attempt alone. For example, the rules might require proficiency with thieves'  tools to pick a specific locj{., so a character who lacks that profi­ciency couldn't help another character in that task. Moreover, a character can help only when two or more individuals working together would actually be productive. Some tasks, such as threading a nee­dle, are no easier with help. SAV IN G  THR OW S  A saving throw-also called a save-represents an attempt to resist certain threats, such as a spell or a trap. A rule or the DM lets ·you know when it's time to make a save for a creature, following these steps: 1: Determine the ability to use. The rules or the DM determines which of the six abilities to use for the save. For example, the DM might say, "Make a Dexterity saving throw to dodge the fire!" 2: Set the Difficulty Class. The DC for a saving throw is determined by the effect that causes it. For example, the DC for a saving throw allowed by a spell is determined by the caster's spellcast­ing ability modifier and proficiency bonus, as ex­plained in chapter 3. 3: Roll  the d20. Then add the appropriate ability modifier. For example, you use your Dexterity modifier for a Dexterity saving throw. If the crea­ture has the relevant saving throw proficiency (noted on the character sheet or stat block), also add the creature's proficiency bonus. As with other d20  rolls, apply any other bonuses and pen­alties, and compare the total to the DC. If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the save is a success. Otherwise,  it's a failure. The result of a successful or failed saving throw is detailed in the descrip­tion of the effect that forced the save. S O C IA L  IN TER A C TION During their adventures, the player's characters meet people from many different walks of life and face monsters that are more keen to talk than fight. In those situations, it's time for social interaction. Interaction takes on many forms. You might need to convince an unscrupulous thief to confess to some wrongdoing, or you might try to flatter a dragon so that it will spare your life. The DM as­sumes the roles· of any NPCs who are participating. ALIGNMENT Characters and many monsters have an  a l i gn ment, which broad ly describes their m o ra l  and ethi ca l  atti­tudes. Alignment i s  a com b i nation of two factors: one identifies moral ity (good, evi l ,  o r  neutral), and the other descri bes attitudes toward  society and o rder (lawfu l ,  chaotic, o r  neutra l ) .  Thus,  nine d isti n ct a l i gn­ments define the possible combinations. Creatu res that lack the capacity for rational thought don't  have alignments-they a re unaligned.  Such crea­tures are i ncapable of m aki n g  moral o r  ethical choices and act accordi n g  to their n atu res. These s u mm aries of the n i n e  align ments describe the typical behavior of a creature with that alignment; i ndividuals vary from that behavior: .Lawful good  (LG) creatu res can be cou nted  on to dothe right t h i ng as expected  by society. Neutral  good  ( N G )  folk do the best they can to help others accord i n g  to their need s. Chaotic good  (CG) creatures act as their con science d i rects, with  l ittle regard for what others expect. Lawful neutral  (LN) i nd ivid uals act in  accord ance with law, trad ition, or personal codes. Neutral  (N)  is the al ign ment of those who steer clear of moral  q uestions, d o i n g  what seems best at the ti me. Chaotic neutral  (CN)  creatures follow their whi ms, hold i n g  their personal freedom a bove all el se. Lawful evil  (LE)  creatu res take what they want, with i n  t h e  l i m its o f  a code o f  tradition, loyalty,  or order. Neutral evil  ( N E)  is the align ment of those who do whatever they can get away with, without q u a l m s. Chaotic evil  (CE)  creatures act with a rbitrary violence, spu rred  by their greed, hatred, or blood l u st. In general terms, an NPC's attitude toward you is described as friendly, indifferent, or hostile. Friendly NPCs are predisposed to help you, and hostile ones are inclined to get in your way. It's easier to get what you want from a friendly NPC. Social interactions have two primary aspects: roleplaying and ability checks. ROLEP LAYI NG Roleplaying is, literally, the act of playing out a role. In this case, it's you as a player determining how your character thinks, acts, and talks. Roleplaying is part of every aspect of the game, and it comes to the fore during social interactions. Your character's per­sonality influences how interactions resolve. The DM uses your character's actions and atti­tudes to determine how an NPC reacts. A cowardly bandit might buckle under threats of imprisonment. A stubborn merchant refuses to let anyone badger her. A vain dragon laps up flattery. When interacting with an NPC, pay close atten­tion to the DM's portrayal of the NPC's personality. You might be able to determine an NPC's goals and then play on them to influence the NPC's attitude. C H A PTER 1  I  P LAYING THE  GAME If you offer NPCs something they want or play on their sympathies, fears, or goals, you can use words to form friendships, ward off  violence,  or learn a key piece of information. On the other hand, if you insult a proud warrior or speak ill of a noble's allies, your efforts to convince or deceive will likely fall short. ABI LITY  C H EC K S  In addition to roleplaying, ability checks can b e  key in determining the outcome of a social interaction. Your roleplaying efforts can alter an NPC's atti­tude, but there might still be an element of chance in the situation. For example, your DM can call for a Charisma check at any  point during an interaction if they want the dice to play a role in determining an NPC's reactions. Other checks might be appropriate in certain situations, at your DM's discretion. Pay attention to your skill proficiencies when thinking of how you want to interact with an NPC, and stack the deck in your favor by using an ap­proach that relies on your skills. For example, if the group needs to trick a guard into letting them into a castle, the rogue who is proficient in Deception is the best bet to lead the discussion. TH E  EN V IR ONM EN T  Adventuring involves delving into places that are dangerous and full of mysteries. The rules in this section cover some of the ways adventurers interact with the environment in such places. TRAV E L  During a n  ad:venture, the characters might travel long distances, on trips that could take hours or days. The DM can summarize this travel without calculating exact distances or travel times. If you need to know how fast people can move when every second matters, use the "Movement & Position" rules ( page  1 1). FALLI NG A creature that falls takes  ld6 bludgeoning dam­age at the end of the fall for every  10 feet it fell, to a maximum of 20d6  (see page  15 for the rules on taking damage). When the creature lands, it suffers the prone con­dition (explained in the appendix),  unless it avoids taking any damage from the fall. A creature that falls into water or another liquid can use its.reaction (see "Reactions" on page  10) to make a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Ac­robatics) check to hit the surface head or feet first. On a successful check, any damage resulting from the fall is halved. C H A PTER  1  I  PLAYING THE  GAME VISION Some of the tasks of adventuring-noticing danger, finding hidden objects,  hitting an enemy in combat, and targeting a spell, to name just a few-rely on a creature's ability to see. Darkness and other effects that obscure vision can prove a hindrance, as ex­plained below. OB SCURE D  A REA S An area might be lightly or heavily obscured. In a lightly obscured area, such as dim light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage, creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight. A heavily obscured area-such as darkness, opaque fog, or dense foliage-blocks vision within it. A creature effectively suffers the blinded condi­tion (explained in the appen�when trying to see something in that area. LIGH T The presence or absence of light in an environment creates three categories of illumination: Bright light lets most creatures see normally. Even gloomy days provide bright light, as do torches, lanterns, fires, and other sources of illumination within a specific radius. Dim light,  also called shadows,  creates a lightly obscured area. An area of dim light is usually a boundary between a source of bright light, such as a torch,  and surrounding darkness. The  soft light of twilight and dawn also counts as dim light. A full moon might bathe the land in dim light. Darkness creates a heavily obscured area. Charac­ters face darkness outdoors at night (even most moonlit nights), within the confines of an unlit dungeon, or in an area of magical darkness. HI DI NG Adventurers and monsters often hide, whether to spy on one another or to set an ambush. The DM-Ue­cides when circumstances are appropriate for hid­ing. When you try to hide, make a Dexterity (Stealth) check. Until you are discovered or stop hiding, that check's total becomes the DC for the Wisdom (Per­ception) check of any creature that searches the area; it finds you only if the check succeeds. WHE N  CA N  I  H I DE? You can try to hide if no one can see you. You can't hide from a creature that can see you clearly, and you give away your position if you make noise, such as shouting a warning or making an attack. An invisible creature can't be seen, so it can always try to hide. Signs of its passage might be noticed, however, and it still has to stay quiet. For more information, see the invisible condition in the appendix. PA SSI VE  PE RCE PTION When you hide, there's a chance someone will no­tice you even if they aren't searching. To determine whether such a creature notices you, the DM com­pares your Dexterity (Stealth) check with that crea­ture's passive Wisdom (Perception) score, which equals  10 + the creature's Wisdom modifier, as well as any other bonuses or penalties. If the creature has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) che.cks, add 5. For disadvantage on such checks, subtract 5.For example, if a  1st-level character (with a profi­ciency bonus of +2) has a Wisdom score of 15 (a +2 modifier) and proficiency in Perception, the charac­ter has a passive Wisdom (Perception) of  14. I NTERACTI NG  WIT H  O BJ E C T S  A character's interaction with objects in a n  environ­ment is simple to resolve in the game. The player tells the DM that their character is doing something, such as moving a lever, and the DM describes what, if anything,  happens. FINDING.HI DDEN THI NGS When your character searches for a hidden object, such as a secret door or a trap, the DM typically asks you to make a Wisdom (Perception) check. If you succeed, you find hidden details or other infor­mation and clues that you might otherwise overlook. In most cases, you need to describe where you are searching. For example, a key is hidden beneath clothes in the top drawer of a bureau. If you tell the DM that you pace around the room, looking at the walls and furniture for clues, you have no chance of finding the key, regardless of your Wisdom (Per­ception) check result. You would have to specify that you were searching the bureau to have any chance of success. SUFF O C ATING A creature can hold its breath for a number of min­utes equal to  1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds). When a creature runs out of breath or is choking, it can survive for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 round). At the start of its next turn, it drops to 0 hit points and is dying, and it can't regain hit points or be stabilized until it can breathe again (see page 15 for the rules on taking damage). C OMBA TAdventurers encounter many dangerous monsters and nefarious villains. In those moments, combat often breaks out. TH E  O RDER OF  C O MBAT A typical combat encounter is a clash between two sides, a flurry of weapon swings, feints, parries, footwork, and spellcasting. The game organizes combat into a cycle of rounds and turns. A round represents about 6 seconds in the game world. During a round, each participant in a battle takes a turn. The order of turns is determined at the begin­ning of combat, when everyone rolls initiative. Once everyone has taken a turn, the fight continues to the next round if neither side is defeated. C O MBAT STE P  BY  STE P  1: Determine surprise. The DM determines whether anyone involved in the combat encounter is surprised. 2: Establish positions.  The DM decides where all the characters and monsters are located. Given the adventurers' marching order or their stated positions in the room or other location, the DM figures out where the adversaries are-how far away and in what direction. 3: Roll initiative. Everyone involved in the combat encounter rolls initiative, determining the order of combatants' turns. 4: Take turns.  Each participant in the battle takes a turn in initiative order. 5: Begin the next  round.  When everyone involved in the combat has had a turn, the round ends. Re­peat step 4 and 5 until the fighting stops. C H A PTER 1  \  P LAYING  T H E  GAMESURPRI SE Adventurers sneak up on a bandit camp, springing from the trees to attack. A stirge swoops down from a cavern ceiling, unnoticed by the adventurers until it's nearly on them. In these situations, one side of the battle gains surprise over the other. The DM determines who might be surprised.  If neither side tries to be stealthy, they automatically notice each other. Otherwise, the DM compares the Dexterity (Stealth) checks of anyone hiding with the passive Wisdom (Perception) score of each creature on the opposing side. Any creature that fails to no­tice a threat is surprised at the start of the combat. If you're surprised, you can't move or take an ac­tion on your first turn of the combat, and you can't take a reaction until that turn ends (see the "Your Turn" and "Reactions"  sections below for informa­tion on actions and reactions). A member of a group can be surprised even if the other members aren't. I NITIATI VE Initiative determines the order of turns during com­bat. When combat starts, every participant makes a Dexterity check to determine their place in the initiative order. The check total is called a combat­ant's initiative count, or initiative for short. The DM makes one roll for a group of identical creatures, so each member of the group acts at the same time. The DM ranks the combatants in order, from the one with the highestinitiative to the one with the lowest. This is the order in which they act during each round. The initiative order remains the same from round to round. If a tie occurs, the DM decides the order among tied monsters, and the players decide the order among their tied characters. The DM decides the order if the tie is between a monster and a player character, or the DM can have the tied characters and monsters each roll a die and go in order from highest roll to lowest. YOUR TURN O n  your turn, you can move a distance up t o  your speed and take one action. You decide whether to move first or take your action first. Your speed­sometimes called your walking speed-is noted on your character sheet. The actions you can take are described in the "Ac­tions in Combat"  section later in this chapter. The "Movement & Position" section later in this chapter gives the rules for your move. Communicating. You can communicate however you are able, through brief utterances and gestures, as you take your turn. Doing so uses neither your action nor your move. Some conditions in the game (see the appendix) inhibit communication. C H APTER 1  I  P LAYING  T H E  GAMEInteracting with T hings. You can interact with one object or feature of the environment for free, during either your move or your action. For exam­ple, you could open a door during your move as you stride toward a foe, or you could draw your weapon as part of the same action you use to attack. If you want to interact with a second object, you need to take the Use an Object action (see page 13). Some magic items and other special objects always require an action to use, as stated in their descriptions. The DM might require you to use an action for any of these activities when it needs special care or when it presents an unusual obstacle. For instance, the DM could reasonably expect you to take an ac­tion to open a stuck door or turn a crank to lower a drawbridge. Doing Nothing on  Your Turn. You can forgo moving, taking an action,  or doing anything at all on your turn. If you can't decide what to do, consider taking the Dodge or Ready action, as described in the "Actions in Combat"  section later in this chapter. B ONUS A CTIONS Various class features, spells, and other abilities let you take an additional action on your turn called a bonus action. The Cunning Action feature, for ex­ample, allows a rogue to take a bonus action. You can take a bonus action only when a special ability, spell, or other feature of the game states that you can do something as a bonus action. You otherwise don't have a bonus action to take. You can take only one bonus action on your turn, so you must choose which bonus action to use when you have more than one available. You choose when to take a bonus action during your turn, unless the bonus action's timing is spec­ified, and anything that deprives you of your ability to take actions also prevents you from taking a bo­nus action. REA CTIONS Certain special abilities, spells, and situations allow you to take a special action called a reaction. A reac­tion is an instant response to a trigger of some kind, which can occur on your turn or on someone else's. The opportunity attack, described later in this chap­ter, is the most common type of reaction. When you take a reaction, you can't take another one until the start of your next turn. If the reaction interrupts another creature's turn, that creature can continue its turn right after the reaction. In terms of timing, a reaction takes place immedi­ately after whatever triggered it, unless the descrip­tion of the reaction says otherwise. MOV E M E N T  &  PO SITI O N  On your turn, you can move a distance equal to your speed or less. Or you can decide not to move. Your movement can include jumping, climbing, and swimming (explained later in this section). These different modes of movement can be com­bined with walking, or they can constitute your entire move. However you're moving, you deduct the distance of each part of your move from your speed until it is used up or until you are done moving. C REATURE  SIZE A creature belongs to a size category. Each size de­termines the width of the square space the creature occupies on a map, as shown on the Size Categories table. That table lists the sizes from smallest (Tiny) to largest (Gargantuan). A character's size is specified on the character sheet  and a monster's size is specified in the moo-ster's stat block. ' . SIZE  CATEG O R I ES Size Tiny Space Size Space 21/2 ft.  square Large 10 ft.  square Small 5 ft. square H uge 15  ft.  square M ed i u m  5  ft.  squ are Gargantua n   20+ ft.  sq u a re BREA KI NG U P  YOUR MOVE ·You can break up your movement on your turn, us­ing some of your speed before and after your action. For example, if you have a speed of 30 feet, you could move  10 feet, take your action, and then move 20 feet. Similarly, if you take an action that includes more than one weapon attack, you can break up your movement by moving between those attacks. If a creature has more than one speed-such as a walking speed and a flying speed-the creature can switch back and forth between the speeds during its move. Whenever it switches, subtract the distance already moved from the new speed. The result de­termines how much farther the creature can move. If the result is 0 or less, it can't use the new speed during the current move. For example, if a creature (such as a harpy) has a walking speed of 20 and a flying speed of 40, it could fly 10 feet, walk 10 feet, and leap into the air to fly 20 feet more. D IFFICULT TE RRA IN Combatants are often slowed down by difficult terrain. Low furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, and shallow bogs are examples of diffi­cult terrain. The space of another creature, whether it's hostile or not, also counts as difficult terrain. Every foot of movement in difficult terrain costs  1 extra foot, even if multiple things in a space count as difficult terrain. BEI NG P RONE Combatants are often knocked down. They are then prone, a condition described in the appendix. You can drop prone without using any of your speed.  Standing up  takes more effort; doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed (round down). For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet of movement to stand up. You can't stand up if you don't have enough movement left or if your speed is 0. MOVING A ROUND OTHE R  C REATURE S You can move through a friend's space. In contrast, you can move through an enemy's space only if the foe is at least two sizes larger or smaller than you. Remember that another creature's space is difficult terrain for you. Whether a creature is a friend or an enemy, you can't willingly end your move in its space. If you leave an enemy's reach during your move, you provoke an opportunity attack (see page  14). FLYI NG Flying creatures have excellent mobility, but they must also deal with the danger of falling. If a flying creature is knocked prone, has its speed reduced to O, or is otherwise deprived of the ability to move, the creature falls, unless it has the ability to hover or it is being held aloft by magic. C LI MBI NG,  SWI M MI NG, A ND  C RAWLI NG Each foot of movement costs  1  extra foot (2 extra feet in difficult terrain) when you're climbing, swim­ming, or crawling. You ignore this extra cost if you have a climbing speed and use it to climb or have a swimming speed and use it to swim. At the DM's option, climbing a slippery vertical surface or one with few handholds might require a successful Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, gaining any distance in rough water might require a successful Strength (Athletics) check. L ONG jUMPS When you make a long jump, you cover a number of feet up to your Strength score if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing long jump, you can leap only half that distance. Either way,  each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement. This rule assumes that the height of your jump doesn't matter, such as a jump across a stream or chasm. At your DM's option, you must succeed on a DC 10 Strength (Athletics)  check to  clear a low obstacle (no taller than a quarter of the jump's dis­tance), such as a low wall. Otherwise, you hit it. When you land in difficult terrain, you must suc­ceed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to land on your feet.  Otherwise,  you land prone. C HA PTER 1  I  PLAYING  T H E  GAME HIGH jUMPS When you make a high jump, you leap into the air a number of feet equal to 3 + your Strength modifier (minimum of 0 feet) if you move at least  10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing high jump, you can jump only half that dis­tance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement. In some circumstances, your DM might allow you to make a Strength (Ath­letics) check to jump higher than you normally can. You can extend your arms half your height above yourself during the jump. Thus, you can reach above yourself a distance equal to the height of the jump plus 1 V2  times your height. ACTIONS I N   C OM BAT When you take your action on your turn, you can take one of the actions presented here. When you describe an action not detailed here, the DM tells what kind of roll you need to make, if any, to deter­mine success or failure. ATTA C K  The most common action to take i n  combat is the Attack action. With this action, you make one at­tack  with  a weapon or an unarmed strike. See  the "Making an Attack" section for the rules that gov­ern attacks. CA ST A  SPELL Most spells require an action to cast. See chapter 3 for the rules on casting a spell. DA SH When you take the Dash action, you gain extra movement for the current turn. The increase equals your speed, after applying any modifiers. With a speed of 30 feet, for example, you can move up to 60 feet on your turn if you take the Dash action. DI SE NGAGE If you take the Disengage action, your movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks (see page  14) for the rest of the turn. D ODGE When you take the Dodge action, you focus on avoiding attacks. Until the start of your next turn, any attack roll made against you has disadvantage if you can see the attacker, and you make Dexterity saving throws with advantage. You lose this benefit if you receive the incapacitated condition (explained in the appendix) or if your speed is reduced to 0 by a condition or another effect. C H A P T ER  l  I  P LAYING T H E   GAME W 11. A R O S   O F T E N  TAKE  T H E   C A S T  A S P E L L  A C T I O N .  HEL P  You can lend your aid to another creature in the completion of a task. When you take the Help ac­tion, the creature you aid gains advantage on the next ability check it makes to perform the task you are helping with, provided that it makes the check before the start of your next turn. Alternatively, you can make it easier to hit a crea­ture within 5 feet of you by distracting the target, such as with a feint. You thereby give advantage to the next attack roll against the target that is made by one of your allies before your next turn. HI DE When you take the Hide action, you make a Dexter­ity (Stealth) check in an attempt to hide, following the rules on page 8 for hiding. If you succeed, -you gain the benefits described in the "Unseen Attack­ers and Targets" section later in this chapter. REA DY Sometimes you want to wait for a particular circum­stance before you act. To do so, you take the Ready action on your turn, which lets you act using your reaction before the start of your next turn. First, you decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger your reaction. Then you choose the action you will take in response to that trigger, or you choose to move up to your speed in response to it. Examples include "If the cultist steps on the trapdoor, I'll pull the lever that opens it," and "If the zombie steps next to me, I'll move away." When the trigger occurs, you can either take your reaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore it. When you ready a spell, you cast it as normal but hold its energy,  which you release with your reaction when the trigger occurs. To be readied, a spell must have a casting time of 1  action,  and holding on to the spell's magic requires concentration (explained in chapter 3). If your concentration is broken, the readied spell dissipates without taking effect. SEA RCH When you take the Search action, you devote your attention to finding something, and the DM might have you make a Wisdom (Perception) check or an Intelligence (Investigation) check. U SE A  MAGI C  ITE M If you have a magic item that requires an action to use, you take the Use a Magic Item action. U SE A N  OBJE CT You normally interact with an object while doing something else, such as when you draw a sword as part of an attack. When a nonmagical object requires your action, you take the Use an Object action. You can also take this action to interact with more than one object on your turn. U SE A  SPE CIAL ABILITY Many class features give you special ways to use your action.  Monsters also have their own special actions, as detailed in their stat blocks. M A KI NG  AN  ATTACK When you t�ke the Attack action, you can make a weapon attack. If you take the Cast a Spell action, some spells involve making a spell attack, and the Use a Magic Item, Use an Object, and Use a Special Ability actions sometimes involve an item or a fea­ture  that requires an attack. Two ATTA C K  TYPE S There are two types of attacks in the game: weapon attacks and spell attacks. The rules tell you an attack's type and whether the type matters in a particular situation. Weapon attacks are generally physical attacks with weapons (listed in chapter 2) and the like. Spell attacks involve spells and other forms of magic. Regardless of an attack's type, it follows the rules in this section,  and if there's ever any question whether something you're doing counts as an at­tack, the rule is simple: if you're making an attack roll, you're making an attack. ATTA C K  STRUCTURE Whether you're striking with a melee weapon, firing a weapon at range, or making an attack roll as part of a spell, an attack has the following structure: 1:  Choose a target. Pick a target within your at- . tack's range: a creature, an object, or a location. 2: Determine modifiers.  The DM determines whether the target has cover and whether you have advantage or disadvantage against the tar­get. In addition, spells,  special abilities, and other effects can apply penalties or bonuses to your attack roll. 3: Resolve the attack.  Make the attack roll. On a hit, you roll damage, unless the particular attack has rules that specify otherwise. Some attacks cause special effects in addition to  or instead of damage. ATTACK ROLL S When you make an attack, your attack roll deter­mines whether the attack hits or misses. To make an attack roll, roll a d20 and add the appropriate modifiers. If the total of the roll plus modifiers equals or exceeds the target's Armor Class (AC), the attack hits. When a character makes an attack roll, the two most common modifiers to the roll are an ability modifier and the character's proficiency bonus. When a monster makes an attack roll, it uses what­ever modifier is provided in its stat block. Ability Modifier.  The ability modifier used for a melee weapon attack is Strength, and  the abil­ity modifier used for a ranged weapon attack is Dexterity. Some spells also require an attack roll. The abil­ity modifier used for a spell attack depends on the spellcasting ability of the spellcaster, as specified on the spellcaster's character sheet or in its stat block. See chapter 3 for more information on ·spellcasting. Proficiency Bonus. You add your proficiency bonus to your attack roll when you attack using a weapon you have proficiency with, as well as when you attack with a spell. ROLLING 1  OR 2 0  I f  a n  attack roll gets a 20 on the d20, the attack hits regardless of any modifiers or the target's AC. This is called a critical hit, which is explained later in this chapter. If an attack roll gets a  1 on the d20, the at­tack misses regardless of any modifiers or the target's AC. U N SEE N ATTACKE RS A N D  TA RGETS When you make an attack roll against a target you can't see, you have disadvantage on the roll. This is true whether you're guessing the target's location or you're targeting a creature you can hear but not see. If the target isn't in the location you targeted, you automatically miss, but the DM typically just says that the attack missed, not whether you guessed the target's location correctly. RANGED ATTACKS When you make a ranged attack, you fire a bow or a crossbow, hurl a handaxe, or otherwise send pro­jectiles to strike a foe at a distance. Many spells also involve making a ranged attack. RA NGE You can make ranged attacks only against targets within a specified range. If a ranged attack, such as one made with a spell,  has a single  range,  you can't attack a target beyond this range. Some ranged attacks, such as those made with a longbow or a shortbow, have two ranges. The smaller number is the normal range, and the larger number is the long range. Your attack roll has disad­vantage when your target is beyond normal range, and you can't attack a target beyond the long range. RA NGE D  ATTACKS I N  CL OSE  C OMBAT Aiming a ranged attack is more difficult when a foe is next to you. When you make a ranged attack with a weapon, a spell, or some other means, you have disadvantage on the attack roll if you are within 5 feet of an enemy who can see you and who isn't incapacitated. MELEE ATTAC K S  Used i n  hand-to-hand combat, a melee attack allows you to attack a foe within your reach. A melee attack . typically uses a handheld weapon. A typical monster makes a melee attack when it strikes with its claws, its horns, its teeth, or another body part. A few spells also involve making a melee attack. REACH A creature has a 5.-foot reach and can thus attack targets within 5  feet of them when making a me­lee attack. Certain creatures have melee attacks with a reach greater than 5 feet, as noted in their descriptions. OPPORTUNITY ATTACKS Combatants constantly watch for enemies to drop their guard. When you move heedlessly past your foes, you put yourself in danger; doing so provokes an opportunity attack. Making an Opportunity Attack. You can make an opportunity attack when an enemy that you can see leaves your reach. To make the opportunity attack, you use your reaction to make one melee weapon attack against the provoking creature. The attack occurs right before the creature leaves your reach. Avoiding  Opportunity Attacks.  You can avoid provoking an opportunity attack by taking the Dis­engage action. You also don't provoke an opportu­nity attack when you teleport or when someone or something moves you without using your movement, liALF  C o v E R   A N D  THRE E - Q UA R T E R S   C o v E R  When a creature can't see you, you have advan­tage on attack rolls against it. If you are hidden-both unseen and unheard­when you make an attack, you give away your loca­tion when the attack hits or misses. C OVER Walls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can pro­vide cover, making a target more difficult to harm. As detailed in the Cover table, there are three de­grees of cover, each of which gives a different benefit to a target. A target can benefit from cover only when an at­tack or other effect originates on the  opposite side of the cover. If a target is behind multiple sources of cover, only the most protective degree of cover applies; the degrees aren't added together. For example, if a target is behind a creature that gives half cover and a tree trunk that gives three-quarters cover, the target has three-quarters cover. COV E R  Cover Degree Benefit to Target  Offered By Half +2 bon us to AC Another creature of and Dexterity any size or an object saving th rows that covers at least half of the ta rget Three-quarters +5 bon us to AC An object that covers a n d  Dexterity at least three-quar-saving th rows ters of the target Total Can't be targeted  An object that covers d irectly the whole target C H A PTER 1  I  PLAYING THE  GAMEaction, or reaction. For example,  you don't provoke an opportunity attack if an explosion hurls you out of a foe's reach or if you fall past an enemy. GRA PPLI NG When you  want  to  grab a creature or wrestle  with it, you can use the Attack action to make a special me­lee attack, a grapple. Starting a  Grapple.  The target of your grapple must be no more than one size larger than you, and it must be within your reach. Using at least one free hand, you try to seize the target by making a grapple check-a Strength (Athletics) check with a DC set by a Stn:ngth (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check the target makes in response (the target chooses the ability to use). You succeed automati­cally if the target is incapacitated. If you succeed, you subject the target to the grap­pled condition (see the appendix). The condition specifies the things that end it, and you can release the target whenever you like (no action required). Escaping  a  Grapple.  A grappled creature can use its action to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check with a DC set by a Strength (Athletics) check you make when it tries to escape. Moving a Grappled Creature. When you move, you can drag or carry the grappled creature with you, but your speed is halved (round down) unless the creature is two or more sizes smaller than you. SH OVI NG A  C REATURE Using the Attack action, you can make a special melee attack to shove a creature, either to knock it prone or to push it away from you. The target of your shove must be no more than one size larger than you, and it must be within your reach. You make a Strength (Athletics) check with a DC set by a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acro­batics) check that the target makes in response (the target chooses the ability to use). You succeed auto­matically if the target is incapacitated. If you succeed, you either knock the target prone or push it 5 feet away from you ( your choice). U NA RME D  STRI KE S  Instead of using a weapon to make a melee attack, you can use an unarmed strike: a punch, kick, head­butt, or similar forceful blow. On a hit, an unarmed strike deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1 + your Strength modifier. You are proficient with your unarmed strikes. They aren't considered weapons by the rules, but they nonetheless work for melee weapon attacks. DAM AGE  &  HEALING lnjury and death are constant threats in D&D, as detailed in the following rules. HIT POI NTS Every creature has hit points, which represent a combination of physical and mental durability, the will to live,  and luck. Creatures with more hit points are more difficult to kill. Those with fewer hit points are more fragile. A creature's current hit points (usually just called .hit points) can be any number from the creature's hit point maximum down to 0, and it never goes lower than 0. This number changes frequently as a ·  creature takes damage  or receives healing. Whenever a creature takes damage,  that damage is subtracted from its hit points. The loss of hit points has no effect on a creature's capabilities until the creature drops to 0 hit points. DAMAGE  ROLL S Each weapon, spell, and harmful monster ability specifies the damage it deals, if any. You roll the damage die or dice, add any modifiers, and apply the damage to your target (minimum of 0 damage). When attacking with a weapon, you add your abil­ity modifier-the same modifier used for the attack roll-to the damage. A spell  tells you which dice to roll for damage and whether to add any modifiers. If a spell or other effect deals damage to more than one target at the same time, roll the damage once for all of them. For example, when a wizard casts thunderwave, the spell's damage is rolled once for all creatures caught in the blast. C RITI CAL  HITS When you score a critical hit, you get to roll extra dice for the attack's damage against the target. Roll all of the attack's damage dice twice and add them together. Then add any relevant modifiers as normal. For example, if you score a critical hit with a dagger, roll 2d4 for the damage,  rather than l d4, and then add your relevant ability modifier. If the attack involves other damage dice, such as from the rogue's Sneak Attack feature, you roll those dice twice as well. DA MAGE  TYPE S Every instance of damage has a type. Damage types have no rules of their own, but other rules, such as damage resistance, rely on the types. The types are acid, bludgeoning, cold, fire, force, lightning, necrotic,  piercing, poison, psychic, radi­ant, slashing, and thunder. C H APTER  1  I  PLAYING T H E   GAME C L E R I C S  A N D  P A LA D I N S  S T R I V E  T O  P R O T E C T  A N O  H E A L  T H E I R   F R I E N D S .  DA MAGE  RE SISTA N CE A N D  VUL NE RABILITY Some creatures and objects are exceedingly difficult or easy to hurt with certain types of damage. If a creature or an object has resistance to a damage type, damage of that type is halved against it (round down). If a creature or an object has vulnerability to a damage type, damage of that type is doubled against it. After all other modifiers to damage, resistance is applied and then vulnerability. For example, 25 bludgeoning damage is dealt to a creature that has bludgeoning resistance. The creature is also within a magical aura that reduces all damage by 5. The 25 damage is first reduced by 5 and then halved, so the creature takes 10 damage. Multiple instances of resistance or vulnerability that affect the same damage type count as only one _instance. For example, if a creature has resistance to fire damage as well as resistance to all nonmag­ical damage, the damage of a nonmagical fire is reduced only by half against the creature. HEA LI NG Unless it results in death, damage isn't permanent. Even death is reversible through powerful magic. Rest can restore a creature's hit points (see page 17),  and magical methods, such as the curewounds spell, can remove damage in an instant. When a creature receives healing of any kind,  hit points regained are added to its current hit points. A creature's hit points can't exceed its hit point maximum, so any hit points regained in excess of this number are lost. For example, a cleric grants a fighter 8 hit points of healing.  If the fighter has  14 current hit points and has a hit point maximum of 20,  the fighter regains 6 hit points, not 8. A creature that has died can't regain hit points un­til magic has restored it to life. D ROPPI NG TO 0  HIT P OINTS When a character drops to 0 hit points, they either die outright or fall unconscious, as explained below. A monster dies when it drops to 0 hit points, unless the DM decides to treat the monster like a character. Instant Death.  Massive damage can  kill a char­acter instantly. When damage reduces a character to 0 hit points and there is damage remaining, the character dies if the remaining damage equals or exceeds their hit point maximum. For example, a wizard with a maximum of  12 hit points currently has 6 hit points. If the wizard takes 18 damage from an attack, the wizard is reduced to 0 hit points, but 12  damage remains. Because the remaining dam­age equals the hit point maximum, the wizard dies. Falling  Unconscious.  If damage reduces a char­acter to 0 hit points and isn't fatal, the character falls unconscious (see the appendix). This unconscious­ness ends if the character regains any hit points. Death Saving  Throws. Whenever your character starts their turn with 0 hit points, you must make a special saving throw, called a death saving throw, to determine whether the character creeps closer to death. Unlike other saving throws, this one isn't tied to any ability score; the character is now in the hands of fate. Roll a d20. The save succeeds on a roll of 10 or higher. Otherwise, it fails. A success or failure has no effect by itself. On the third success, the charac­ter becomes stable (see below). On the third failure, the character dies. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive;  keep track of both until you collect three of a kind. The number of both is reset to zero when the character regains any hit points or become stable. When you make a death saving throw and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as two failures. If you roll a 20 on the d20, your character regains 1 hit point. Damage at 0 Hit Points.  If a character takes any damage while at 0 hit points, the character suffers one death saving throw failure. If the damage is from a critical hit, it's two failures instead. If the damage equals or exceeds the character's hit point maximum, the character dies instantly. Stabilizing a  Creature.  The best way to save a creature with 0 hit points is to heal it. If healing is unavailable, the creature can at least be stabilized so that it isn't killed by a failed death saving throw. As an action, you can administer first aid to a crea­ture with 0 hit points, which requires a successful DC  10 Wisdom (Medicine) check. On a success, the creature is stable, which means the creature doesn't make death saving throws, even though it has 0 hit points, but it does remain unconscious. The creature stops being stable, and must start making death saving throws again, if it takes any damage. A stable creature that isn't healed regains 1 hit on the turn that you mount it. In contrast, an in­dependent mount retains its place in the initiative order, and it moves and acts as it wishes. Opportunity Attacks against You. If the mount you're riding provokes an opportunity attack, the attacker can target you or the mount. point after  ld4 hours. KNO C KI NG A  CREATURE OUT When an attacker reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack, the attacker can knock the crea­ture out. The attacker makes this choice the instant the damage is dealt. The creature suffers the uncon­scious condition (see the appendix) and is stable. HA RMI NG OBJECTS Creatures can damage objects with weapons and spells. The DM determines an object's Armor Class and hit points. Objects are immune to poison and psychic damage, and the DM might decide that cer­tain objects have resistance or immunity to other types of damage (it's hard to cut a rope with blud­geoning damage, for example). Objects always fail Strength and Dexterity saving throws, and they are immune to effects that require other saves. When an object drops to 0 hit points, it breaks. A creature can also make a Strength check to try to break an object, with a DC set by the DM. MOU NTED  C OM BAT A willing creature that is at least one size larger than a rider and that has an appropriate anatomy can serve as a mount, using the following rules: Mounting and Dismounting.  During your move, you can mount a creature that is within 5 feet of you or dismount. Doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed (round down). For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend  15 feet of movement to mount a horse. Falling Off.  If an effect moves your mount against its will while you're on it, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or be dismounted, landing prone in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of it. If you're knocked prone while mounted, you must make the same save. If your mount is knocked prone, you can use your reaction to dismount it as it falls and land on your feet. Oth­erwise, you are dismounted and fall prone in an unoccupied space within 5 feet it. Controlling a Mount. You can control a mount only if it has been trained to accept a rider. Domesti­cated horses, donkeys, and similar creatures are assumed to have such training. The initiative of a controlled mount changes to match yours when you mount it. It moves as you direct it, and it has only three action  options:  Dash, Disengage, and Dodge. A controlled mount can move and act even UN DERWATER C O MBAT A fight underwater follows these rules: Impeded  Melee. When making a melee weapon at­tack, a creature that lacks a swimming speed has disadvantage on the attack roll unless the weapon is a dagger, javelin, shortsword, spear, or trident. Reduced Range. A ranged weapon attack auto­matically misses a target beyond the weapon's normal range. Even against a target within normal range, the attack roll has disadvantage unless the weapon is a crossbow or a weapon with the thrown property. Fire Resistance. While fully immersed, creatures and objects have resistance to fire damage. R E STIN G  Creatures in the game can take short rests in the midst of a day and a long rest to end it. SHORT  R E ST A short rest is a period of downtime-at least 1 hour long-during which a creature does nothing more strenuous than  eating,  drinking, and reading. A creature can spend one or more Hit Dice at the end of a short rest, up to the creature's maximum number of Hit Dice (noted in the character sheet or stat block). For each Hit Die spent in this way, the player rolls the die and adds the creature's Consti­tution modifier to it. The creature regains hit points equal to the total (minimum of 0). The player can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after each roll. LONG R E ST A long rest is a period of extended downtime-at least 8 hours long-during which a creature sleeps for at least 6 hours and performs no more than 2 hours of light activity, such as reading,  talking,  eat­ing, or standing watch.  If the  rest is interrupted by a period of strenuous activity-at least  1 hour of walk­ing, fighting, casting spells, or similar activity-the creature must restart the rest to gain any benefit. At the end of a long rest, a creature regains all lost hit points. The creature also regains spent Hit Dice, up to half of the creature's total number of them (round down; minimum of one die). A creature can't benefit from more than one long rest in a 24-hour period, and a creature must have at least 1 hit point at the start of the rest to gain its benefits. C H A PTER  1  I  PLAYING THE  GAMECHAPTER  2E QUIPMENT ADVENTURERS ACQUIRE MANY  KINDS OF  EQUIPMENT on their journeys. This chapter describes equipment that appears on a character sheet and that can be added to the sheet later. Characters gain most of their equipment by buying it in a shop or finding it in a dungeon. Adventurers also sometimes find magic items, the details of which the DM provides. C O IN S  Characters find coins on their adventures and can spend those coins in shops, inns, and other busi­nesses they visit. Coins come in different denomina­tions based on the relative worth of their material. The Coin V�lues table lists the coins and how much they're worth relative to one another. For example, it shows  that a gold piece is worth 100 copper pieces. A coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound.

The DM lets you know if a shop has a particular item for sale and whether it's available for the standard price. If you want to sell something, equipment fetches half its cost when sold. Weapons and armor used by monsters are rarely in good enough condition to sell. In contrast, gems,  jewelry, and art objects re­tain their full value in the marketplace, a.nd in most places, magic items are priceless and therefore diffi­cult to sell. E QU I PM EN T  PR OFIC I EN C I E S  Anyone can equip the items in this chapter, but the following items require you to have proficiency with the item to unlock all of the item's functionality: Armor. Anyone can don a suit of armor, but only those proficient with it can wear it effectively. Your character sheet lists your character's armor proficiencies. If you wear armor that you lack pro­ficiency with, you have disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can't cast spells. Weapons. Anyone can wield a weapon, but you must have proficiency with it to add your profi­ciency bonus to an attack roll you make with it. A R M O R  Armor Armor Class (AC) Strength Stealth Cost Weight Light Armor (1  minute to don or doff) Leather 11  + Dex modifier Studded  l eather 12  + Dex modifier Medium Armor (5 minutes to don and 7  minute to doff) H ide Chain s h i rt Scale mail B reastplate Half plate 12  +  Dex modifier (max 2) 1 3  +  Dex  modifier (max 2) 1 4  + Dex modifier (max 2) 1 4  +  Dex modifier (max 2) l S  + Dex modifier (max 2) Heavy Armor ( 7 0  minutes to don and 5  minutes to doff) R i n g  m a i l  Chain m a i l  S p l i nt Plate 1 4  1 6  1 7 1 8  Tools.  Certain tools, such as thieves' tools, require you to have proficiency with the tool to add your proficiency bonus to your ability checks with it. ARM OR The Armor table gives the key  details of  the various armors available. A creature can wear only one suit of armor at a time. The table lists the cost and weight of the armor, as well as the following details: Category. Every type of armor falls into a category: light, medium, or heavy. The category determines how long it takes to don or doff the armor (as shown in the table), and armor proficiencies are usually tied to one or more of the categories. Armor Class (AC). The table's AC column tells you what your base AC is when you wear a particular type of armor. For example, if you wear leather armor, your AC is  11 plus your Dexterity modifier, whereas your AC is 16 if you wear chain mail. Strength. If the table shows a Strength score in the Strength column for an armor type,  that armor reduces the wearer's speed by 10 feet unless the wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher than the listed score. Stealth.  If the table shows "Disadvantage" in the Stealth column, the wearer has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. WEA PON S The Weapons table shows the game's most common weapons. A creature must have a weapon in hand to wield it. The table lists the cost and weight of the weapon, as well as the following details: Category.  Every weapon falls into a category: simple or martial. Weapon proficiencies are usually tied to one of these categories. For example, you might have proficiency with simple weapons. 1 0  gp 4S g p  1 0  gp so g p  s o  gp 400 gp 7SO gp 30 gp 7S gp 200 gp l , SOO gp 10 l b  1 3  l b  1 2  l b  2 0  l b  4S l b  20 l b  40 1 b  40 l b  SS lb 60 l b  6S l b  Disadvantage Disadva ntage Disadvantag e Di sadvantage Disadva ntage Disadvantage Str 1 3  Str l S Str l S Melee o r  Ranged. A weapon i s  classified as either melee or ranged. A melee weapon is used to attack a target within 5 feet, whereas a ranged weapon is made to attack at a greater distance. Damage. The table lists the amount of damage a weapon deals when an attacker hits with it. Properties. If a weapon has a property, that prop­erty is listed in the Properties column. Each prop­erty is defined in the "Weapon Properties" section. WEAPON PROPERT I E S  Here are definitions of the properties in the Proper­ties column of the Weapons table: Ammunition. You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from it. Each attack expends one piece of ammunition.  Drawing the ammunition is part of the attack ( you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). After a fight, you can spend 1 minute to recover half the ammunition (round down) you used in the fight. ·  Finesse. When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls. Heavy.  Small and Tiny creatures have disadvan­tage on attack rolls with weapons that have the heavy property. Light. When you take the Attack action and attack with a weapon that has the light property, you can use a bonus action to attack with a different weapon that has the light property in your other hand. Don't add your ability modifier to the bonus attack's damage, unless the modifier is negative. Loading. You can fire only one piece of ammunition from a loading weapon when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long  range. Reach.  A reach weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determin­ing your reach for opportunity attacks with it. Thrown. If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength,  but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property. Two-Handed. This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it. Versatile. This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property. That's the damage dealt when the weapon is used with two hands to make a me­lee attack. C H A PTER  2  I  E QUIPMENT I M PROVISED WEA P O N S  An improvised weapon i s  an object wielded as a makeshift weapon, such as broken glass, a table leg, or a frying pan. Even a simple or martial weapon counts as an improvised weapon if it's wielded in a way contrary to its design; if you use a ranged weapon to make a melee attack or throw a melee weapon that lacks the thrown property, the weapon counts as an improvised weapon for that attack. Here are the rules for an improvised weapon: Proficiency. You don't add your proficiency bonus to attack rolls with it. Damage. On a hit, the weapon deals ld4 damage of a type the DM thinks is appropriate to the object. Range. If you throw the weapon, it has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. If an improvised weapon resembles a weapon on the Weapons table,  the DM may say it functions as that weapon and uses that weapon's rules. For ex­ample, the DM could treat a table leg as a club. A DV EN TUR IN G  GEAR Here are some special items (with their prices and weights) that adventurers find useful: Candle (1  cp, 0 lb). For 1 hour, this candle sheds bright light in a 5 -foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet. Disguise Kit (25 gp, 3 lb). This pouch of cosmetics and props lets you create disguises. Proficiency with this kit lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to create a disguise. Healer's Kit (5 gp, 3 lb). This kit is a pouch contain­ing bandages, salves, and splints. It has ten uses. As an action, you can expend one use of the kit to stabilize a creature that has 0 hit points, without needing to make a Wisdom ( Medicine) check. Holy Water (25 gp,  1  lb). As an action, you can splash this water onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on im­pact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a target  creature,  treating the holy water as an improvised weapon. If the target is a Fiend or an Undead, it takes 2d6 radiant damage on a hit. Lantern, Bullseye  (10  gp,  2 lb). This lantern casts bright light in a 60-foot cone and dim light for an additional 60 feet. It burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil. Lock  (10  gp,  1  lb). A key is provided with this lock. A creature proficient with thieves' tools can pick the lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Oil (1 sp,  1  lb). This oil comes in a flask that holds 1 pint. As an action, you can splash the oil onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 LIFTING AND CA R RYING Here a re the  rules for how m u c h  a creature can  ca rry. Carrying Capacity. You r  carryi ng capacity is your Strength score m u ltiplied by 1 5 . This i s  the weight (in poun ds) that you can ca rry, which is h igh enough that most characters d on't usually have to worry about it. Push, Drag, or Lift. You can push, d rag, or l i ft a weight in  pounds u p  to twice your carrying capacity (or 30 times you r Strength score). While pushing or d rag­ging weight in excess of your carrying capacity, your speed d rops to 5 feet. Size and Strength.  La rger creatures can  bear m o re weight, whereas Tiny creatu res can carry less. For each size category above M e d i u m ,  double the creature's carrying capacity and the a m o u nt it can p u s h ,  d rag, or l ift.  For a Tiny creature, h alve these weights. feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a target, treating the oil as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target is covered in oil. If the target takes any fire damage before the oil dries (after 1 minute), the target takes an additional 5 fire damage from the burning oil. You can also pour a flask of oil on the ground to cover a 5 -foot­square area that is level. If lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds and deals 5 fire damage to any creature that enters the area or ends its turn there. A crea­ture can take this damage only once per turn. Quiver (1 gp,  1  lb). This quiver holds up to 20 ar­rows or bolts. Rations (5 sp,  2 lb). These rations are enough for one person for one day and include jerky, dried fruit, hardtack, and nuts. Rope,  Hempen (1  gp,  10 lb) or Silk (10  gp, 5 lb). This rope is 50 feet long, has 2 hit points, and can be burst with a DC 17 Strength check. Shield  (10  gp, 6 lb). This shield is made of wood or metal. Equipping it requires an action. While equipped, the shield increases your AC by 2 if you have shield proficiency. You can benefit from only one shield at a time. Thieves' Tools (25 gp,  1 lb). This set of tools in­cludes a small file, lock picks, a small mirror with a metal handle, a set of narrow-bladed scissors, and a pair of pliers. Proficiency with these tools lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to disarm traps or open locks. Tinderbox (5 sp,  1  lb). This container holds flint, fire steel, and tinder used to kindle a fire. Using it to light a torch-or anything else with abundant, exposed fuel-takes an action. Lighting any other fire takes  1 minute. Torch (1  cp,  1  lb). This torch burns for  1 hour, providing bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. If you make a me­lee attack with a burning torch and hit,  it deals 1 fire damage. C H A PTER  2  I  EQUIPMENT CHAPTER  3SPELLS MAGIC PERMEATES  THE  WORLDS  OF  D&D  AND  MOST often appears in the form of a magic spell. This chapter provides the rules for casting spells, which can create many sorts of wonders. The chapter also includes a collection of spells for use by spellcasters, such as the cleric, the wizard, and the paladin. GA I N ING SPELLS Before a spellcaster can use a spell, they must have the spell  firmly fixed in mind or must have access to the  spell in a magic  item.  Members of a few classes (such as the sorcerer in the Player's Handbook) have a limited list of spells that are always fixed in mind. The same thing is true of many magic-using monsters. Other spellcasters, such as clerics and wizards, undergo a process of preparing spells. This process varies for different classes, as detailed in the description of their Spellcasting features. CA STING A  SPELL Whenever a creature casts a spell, the same basic rules are followed, and the descriptions of all spells are structured alike. Each spell description begins with the spell's name, level, school of magic, casting time, range, components, and duration. The rest of a spell entry describes the spell's effect. The following sections explain each part of a spell description. SPELL LEVEL Every spell has a level from 0 to 9, which is indi­cated in a spell's description. A spell's level is a gen­eral indicator of how powerful it is. Cantrips-sim­ple spells that can be cast almost by rote-are level 0. The rules for each spellcasting class (shown onthe character sheet) say when members of that class gain access to spells of certain levels. SPE LL SLOTS Spellcasting is taxing, so a spellcaster can cast only a limited number of spells before resting. Spell slots are the main way a spellcaster's magical potential is represented, and each spellcasting class gives its members a limited number of spell slots of certain spell levels. For example, a 3rd-level wizard has four 1st-level spell slots and two 2nd-level slots. When you cast a spell, you expend a slot of that spell's level or higher, effectively "filling" a slot with the spell. You can think of a spell slot as a groove of a certain size-small for a 1st-level slot, larger for a spell of higher level. A 1st-level spell fits into a slot of any size,  but a 2nd-level spell fits only in a slot that's at least 2nd level. So when a 3rd-level wizard casts magic missile,  a  1st-level spell, that wizard spends one of four 1st-level slots and has three remaining. Finishing a long rest restores any expended spell slots (see page  17 for the rules on resting). CASTI NG AT A HIGHE R LE VE L When a spellcaster casts a spell using a slot that is of a higher level than the spell, the spell takes on the higher level for that casting. For instance, if a wizard casts magic missile using a 2nd-level slot, that magic missile  is 2nd level. Effectively, the spell expands to fill the slot it is put into. Some spells, such as magic missile  and curewounds, have more powerful effects when cast at a higher level, as detailed in a spell's description. C ASTI NG WITH OUT SLOTS There are several ways to cast a spell without ex­pending a spell slot: Cantrips. A spell of 0 level (aka a cantrip) can be cast without a spell slot. Rituals.  Certain spells have a special tag: "ritual." Such a spell can be cast following the normal rules for spellcasting, or the spell can be cast as a ritual. The ritual version of a spell takes 10 min­utes longer to cast than normal. It also doesn't ex­pend a spell slot. To cast a spell as a ritual, a spell­caster _must have a feature that grants the ability to do so. The cleric and wizard, for example, have such a feature. The caster must also have the spell prepared, unless the character's ritual feature specifies otherwise, as the wizard's does. Special Abilities. Some characters and monsters have special abilities that allow them to cast spe­cific spells without a spell slot. This casting is usu­ally limited in another way, such as being able to cast the spell a limited number of times per day. Magic Items. Spell scrolls and some other magic items contain spells that can be cast without a spell slot. The description of such an item speci­fies how many times a spell can be cast from it. S C H O O L  OF  M AGIC Each spell is part of a magical category, which is called a school of magic. The schools of magic are listed in the Schools of Magic table. These catego­ries help describe spells but have no rules of their own, although some other rules refer to them. S C H O OLS  OF  MAG IC School Typical Effects Abj u ration Prevents o r  negates harmfu l  effects Conj u ration Transports creatures or objects Divination Reveals thoughts, p l aces , and times Enchantment I nfluences others' m i nds CASTING IN ARM O R  Because o f  t h e  mental focus and precise gestures req u i red for spellcasti n g, you  must be proficient with the armor you are wearing to cast a  spell  (as noted i n  ch apter 2) . You  a re otherwise too d istracted and physi­cally h a m pered  by your armor for spel lcasting. CASTING TI M E  Most spells require a single action to cast, but some spells require a bonus action, a reaction,  or much more time to cast. BONUS A CTION A spell cast with a bonus action is especially swift. You must use a bonus action on your turn to cast the spell, provided that you haven't already taken a bonus action this turn. You can't cast another spell during the same turn, except for a cantrip with a casting time of  1 action. RE ACTIONS Some spells can be cast as reactions. These spells take a fraction of a second to bring about and are cast in response to some event. If a spell can be cast as a reaction, the spell description tells you exactly when you can do so. LONGE R CASTI NG TIME S  Certain spells (including spells cast as rituals) require more time to cast: minutes or even hours. When you cast a spell with a casting time longer than a single action or reaction, you must spend your action each turn casting the spell, and you must maintain your concentration while you do so (see "Concentration"  later in this chapter). If your concentration is broken, the spell fails, but you don't expend a spell slot. If you want to try casting the spell again, you must start over. RANGE A spell's range indicates how far away from the spellcaster the spell's effect can originate, and the spell's description specifies which part of the effect is limited by the range. Once a spell is cast, its ef­fects aren't restricted by its range, unless the spell's description says otherwise. A range typically takes one of the following forms: Distance. The range is expressed in feet. Touch. The spell's effect originates on something the spellcaster must touch, as defined in the spell. Self. A spell with a range of "Self" can be cast only Evocation Channels magical energy to create de-on the spellcaster. structive o r  healing effects I l lusion Deceives the m i n d  o r  senses N ecromancy M a n i p u lates l i fe and death Transm utation  Transforms creatures or objects Self (Area of Effect). A spell with a range of "Self" followed by an area of effect in parentheses, such as "Self ( 15 -foot cone)," creates an area of effect that originates from the spellcaster (see "Areas of Effect" later in this chapter). C H A PTER 3  I  SPELLS C OM P O N E NT S  S P E L L C A S T I  N G   FO C U S E S  A spell's components are the physical requirements the spellcaster must meet in order to cast it. Each spell's description indicates whether it requires ver­bal (V ), somatic (S), or material ( M )  components. If the spellcaster can't provide one or more of a spell's components, the spellcaster can't cast the spell. VE RBAL  (V) A verbal component is the chanting of mystic words. The words themselves aren't the source of the spell's power; rather, the particular combination of sounds, with specific pitch and resonance, sets the threads of magic in motion. Thus, a creature who is gagged or in an area of magical silence can't cast a spell with a verbal component. SOMATI C  (S) Spellcasting gestures might include a forceful gesticulation or an intricate set of gestures.  If a spell requires a somatic component, the caster must have free use of at least one hand to perform these gestures. MATE RIAL  (M) Casting some spells requires particular materials, as specified in parentheses in the Components en­try. These materials aren't consumed by the spell, unless the spell's description states otherwise. The spellcaster must have a hand free to access them, but it can be the same hand used to perform so­matic components, if any. Instead of providing the materials specified in a spell, a spellcaster can use a component pouch or a spellcasting focus (both  described below) as the ma­terial component. This option is available only when a spell doesn't consume its materials and doesn't specify a cost for them. Component Pouch (25 gp,  2 Jb).  A component pouch is a small, watertight leather belt pouch that has compartments holding all of a spellcaster's free, non-consumable material components. The pouch can be used by any spellcaster. SpelJcasting Focus.  Some spellcasters have the special ability to use an object called a spellcasting focus as their spells' material component. Focus Usage Cost  Weight Arcane Focuses  (Wizards) Crystal Orb Rod Staff Wan d  Held Held H e l d  Held Held Holy Symbols  (Clerics and Paladins) Amu let Emblem Held o r  worn H e ld o r  worn Reliq u ary Held o r  worn D U RATION 10 g p  20 gp 1 0  g p  5  g p  10 g p  5  gp 5  gp 5  gp 1  l b  3  lb 2 l b  4 l b  1  l b  1  lb 2 l b A spell's duration is the length of time the spell per­sists after it is cast. A duration typically takes one of the following forms: Concentration. A duration that requires concentra­tion follows the concentration rules below. Instantaneous. A duration of "Instantaneous" means the spell appears only for a moment and can't be dispelled. Time Span. A duration that provides a time span specifies how long the spell lasts in rounds, min­utes, hours, or the like. For example, a Duration entry might say "1 minute," meaning the spell ends after 1 minute has passed. C ON CE NTRATION Some spells require the spellcaster to concentrate to keep the spells' magic active. If the spellcaster loses concentration, such a spell ends. If a spell must be maintained with concentration, that fact appears in its Duration entry, and  the spell specifies how long the spellcaster can concentrate on it. The spellcaster can end concentration at any time (no action required). Normal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn't interfere with concentration. The following factors can break concentration: Casting Another Concentration Spell. The spell­caster loses concentration on a spell if they start casting another spell that requires concentration. The Spellcasting Focuses table lists focuses avail­Taking Damage. Whenever a spellcaster takes able to wizards (arcane focuses) as well as clerics and paladins (holy symbols). The table's Usage col­umn indicates whether the spellcaster has to hold o_z wear a focus to use it. damage while concentrating on a spell, they must succeed on a Constitution saving throw to main­tain concentration. The DC equals 10 or half the damage taken (round down), whichever is higher. Being Incapacitated or Killed.  A spellcaster loses concentration on a spell if they die or suffer the incapacitated condition (see the appendix). AREAS  OF  EFFECT Spells such as thunderwave  cover an area called an area of effect, which uses the special rules here. Some other game features, such as a dragon's breath, also use these rules. The description of a spell or another feature spec­ifies whether it has an area of effect, which typically has one of five different shapes: cone, cube, cylinder, line, or sphere.  Every area of effect has a point of origin, a location from which the effect's energy erupts. The rules for each shape specify how to posi­tion its point of origin. Typically, a point of origin is a point in space, but some effects have an area whose origin is a creature or an object. An effect expands in straight lines from the point of origin. If no unblocked straight line extends from the point of origin to a location within the area of ef­fect, that location isn't included in the area. To block one of these imaginary lines, an obstruction must provide  total cover. C ONE A cone extends in a direction that its creator chooses from its point of origin. A cone's width at a given point along its length is equal to that point's distance from the point of origin. A cone's area of effect specifies its maximum length. A cone's point of origin isn't included in the cone's area of effect, unless its creator decides otherwise. C UBE A cube's creator selects its point of origin, which lies anywhere on a face of the cubic effect. The cube's size is expressed as the length of each side. A cube's point of origin isn't included in the cube's area of effect, unless its creator decides otherwise. CYLI N DE R  A cylinder's point of origin is the center of a circle of a particular radius, as given in the effect's de­scription. The circle must either be on the ground or at the top of the effect. The energy in a cylinder expands in straight lines from the point of origin to the perimeter of the circle, forming the base of the cylinder. The effect then shoots up from the base or down from the top, to a distance equal to the height of the cylinder. A cylinder's point of origin is included in  the cylin­der's area of effect. LI NE A line extends from its point of origin in a straight path up to its length and covers an area defined by its width. A line's point of origin isn't included in the line's area of effect, unless its creator decides otherwise. SPHE RE A sphere's creator selects its point of origin, and the sphere extends outward from that point. The sphere's size is expressed as a radius that extends from the point. A sphere's point of origin is included in the sphere's area of effect. C H A P T E R  3  I  SPELLS TARGETS A typical spell requires the caster to pick one or more targets to be affected by the spell's magic. A spell's description says whether the spell targets creatures,  objects, a point of origin for an area of effect, or something else. Unless a spell has a perceptible effect, a creature might not know it was targeted by the spell. An effect like lightning is obvious,  but a more subtle effect,  such as an attempt to read thoughts,  typically goes unnoticed, unless a spell says otherwise. A  CLEAR PATH TO THE TARGET To target something with a spell, a caster must have a clear path to it, so it can't be behind total cover. If a spellcaster places an area of effect at an unseen point and an obstruction, such as a wall, is between the caster and that point,  the point of origin comes into being on the near side of that obstruction. SPELL D E S CR I PTION S The spells are presented in alphabetical order. A spell's caster is the "you" addressed in the spell's description. BLESS 1st-Level Enchantment Casting Time:  1 action Range:  30 feet Components: V, S, M (a sprinkling of holy water) Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute You bless up to three creatures of your choice within range. Whenever a target makes an attack roll or a saving throw before the spell ends, the target can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the attack roll or saving throw. At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above  1st. TARGETING YOURSELF If a spell targets a creature of your choice, you can choose yourself, unless the creature must be hostile or specifically a creature other than you. If you are in the area of effect of a spell you cast, you can tar­get yourself. COMMAND 1st-Level Enchantment Casting Time:  1 action Range: 60 feet Components: V Duration:  1 round SAVING TH ROWS Many spells specify that a target must make a sav­ing throw to avoid some or all of a spell's effects. The spell specifies the ability that the target uses for the save and what happens on a success or failure. Spell save DC = 8  + your proficiency bonus + your spel lcasting ability modifier ATTACK ROLLS Some spells require the caster to make an attack roll to determine whether the spell hits a target. Spell attack modifier = your p roficiency bonus + your spel lcasting ability modifier C O M BIN IN G  SPE LLS The effects of different spells add together while their durations overlap. In contrast, the effects of the same spell cast multiple times don't combine. Instead, the most potent effect-such as the highest bonus-from those castings applies while their du­rations overlap. Or the most recent effect applies if the castings are equally potent and their durations overlap. For example, if two clerics cast bless on the same target,  that character gains the spell's benefit only once; the target doesn't receive two bonus dice. You speak a one-word command to a creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or follow the command on its next turn.  The spell has no effect if the target is Undead, if it doesn't understand your language, or if your command is directly harmful to it. Some typical commands and their effects follow. You might issue a command other than one de­scribed here. If you do so, the DM determines how the target behaves. If the target can't follow your command, the spell ends. Approach. The target moves toward you by the shortest and most direct route, ending its turn if it moves within 5 feet of you. Drop.  The target drops whatever it is holding and then ends its turn. Flee.  The target spends its turn moving away from you by the fastest available means. Grovel.  The target falls prone and then ends its turn. Halt.  The target doesn't move and takes no ac­tions. A flying creature stays aloft, provided that it is able to do so. If it must move to stay aloft, it flies the minimum distance needed to remain in the air. At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can affect one additional creature for each slot level above  1st. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

You also understand any written language that you see, but you must be touching the surface on which the words are written. It takes about 1 minute to read one page of text. This spell doesn't decode secret messages in a text or a glyph, such as an arcane sigil, that isn't part of a written language. CURE WOUN D S  1st-Level Evocation Casting Time:  1 action Range: Touch Components: V, S Duration:  Instantaneous A creature you touch regains a number of hit points equal to  ld8 + your spellcasting ability modifier.

D ETECT MAGIC 1st-Level Divina tion  (Ritual) Casting Time:  1 action Range: Self Components: V, S Duration: Concentration, up to  10 minutes For the duration, you sense the presence of magic within 30 feet of you. If you sense magic in this way, you can use your action to see a faint aura around any visible creature or object in the area that bears magic, and you learn its school of magic, if any. The spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone,  1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt. FLAMING SPHERE 2nd-Level Conjuration Casting Time:  1 action Range: 60 feet Components:  V, S,  M (a bit of tallow, a pinch of brimstone, and a dusting of powdered iron) Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute A 5 -foot-diameter sphere of fire appears in an unoc­cupied space of your choice within range and lasts for the duration. Any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of the sphere must make a Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 2d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a suc­cessful one (round down). As a bonus action, you can move the sphere up to 30 feet. If you ram the sphere into a creature, that creature must make the save against the sphere's damage, and the sphere stops moving this turn. When you move the sphere, you can  direct it over barriers up to 5 feet tall and jump it across pits up to  10 feet wide. The sphere ignites flammable ob­jects not being worn or carried, and it sheds bright light in a 20 -foot radius and dim light for an addi­tional 20 feet. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage in­creases by  ld6 for each slot level above 2nd. GUI DI NG B OLT 1st-Level Evocation Casting Time:  1 action Range:  120 feet Components: V, S Duration:  1 round A flash of light streaks toward a creature of your choice within  range.

At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage in­creases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st. HEA LI NG WORD 1st-Level Evocation Casting Time:  1  bonus action Range: 60 feet Components: V Duration: Instantaneous A creature of your choice that you can see within range regains hit points equal to 1d4 + your spell­casting ability modifier.

On a success, the spell ends on the target. At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional Humanoid for each slot level above 2nd. The Humanoids must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

Until the spell ends, the object sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. The light can be colored as you like. Completely covering the object with something opaque blocks the light. The spell ends if you cast it again or dismiss it as an action. If you target an object held or worn by a hostile creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw to avoid the spell. MAGE A RMOR 1st-Level Abjuration Casting Time:  1 action Range: Touch Components: V, S, M (a piece of cured leather) Duration: 8 hours You touch a willing  creature who isn't wearing ar­mor, and a protective magical force surrounds it un­til the spell ends.

The spell ends if the target dons armor or if you dismiss the spell as an action. MAGE  HA N D  Conjuration  Cantrip Casting Time:  1 action Range:  30 feet Components: V, S Duration:  1 minute A spectral, floating hand appears at a point you choose within range. The hand lasts for the duration or until you dismiss it as an action. The hand van­ishes if it is ever more than 30 feet away from you or if you cast this spell again. You can use your action to control the hand. You can use the hand to manipulate an object,  open an unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a vial.

P RE STIDIGITATION Transmutation  Cantrip Casting Time:  1 action Range:  10 feet Components: V, S Duration: Up to 1 hour This spell is a minor magical trick that novice spell­casters use for practice. You create one of the follow­ing magical effects within range: •  You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as a shower of sparks, a puff of wind, faint musical notes, or an odd odor. •  You instantaneously light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire. •  You instantaneously clean or soil an  object no larger than  1 cubic foot. •  You chill, warm,  or flavor up to  1  cubic foot of non­living material for 1 hour. •  You make a color, a small mark,  or a symbol ap­pear on an object or a surface for 1 hour. •  You  create a nonmagical trinket or an illusory image that can fit in your hand and that lasts until the end of your next turn.

P ROTE CTION FROM EVIL A ND  Goon 1st-Level Abjuration Casting Time:  1 action Range: Touch Components: V, S, M (holy water  or powdered sil-ver and iron, which the spell consumes) Duration:  Concentration,  up to  10 minutes Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is protected against certain types of creatures: Aberrations,  Celestials, Elementals, Fey, Fiends, and Undead. The protection grants several benefits. Creatures of those types have disadvantage on attack rolls against the target. The target also can't be charmed, frightened, or possessed by them. If the target is already charmed, frightened, or possessed by such a creature, the target has advantage on any new sav­ing throw against the relevant effect. RAY OF FROST Evocation  Cantrip Casting Time:  1 action Range:  60 feet Components: V, S Duration: Instantaneous A frigid beam of blue-white light streaks toward a creature within range.  Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, it takes 1d8 cold dam­age, and its speed is reduced by  10 feet until the start of your next turn.

SACRED FLAME Evocation  Cantrip Casting Time:  1 action Range: 60 feet Components: V, S Duration: Instantaneous Flame-like radiance descends on a creature that you can see within range.

SANCTUARY 1st-Level Abjuration Casting Time:  1 bonus action Range: 30 feet Components: V, S,  M (a small silver mirror) Duration:  1 minute You ward a creature within range against attack. Until the spell ends, any creature who targets the warded creature with an attack or a harmful spell must first make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or lose the attack or spell. This spell doesn't protect the warded creature from area effects, such as the ex­plosion of a fireball. If the warded creature makes an attack, casts a spell that affects an enemy, or deals damage to an­other creature, this spell ends.

Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A crea­ture made of inorganic material such as stone, crys­tal, or metal has disadvantage on this saving throw. A nonmagical object that isn't being worn or car­ried also takes the damage if it's in the spell's area. At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage in­creases by  1d8 for each slot level above 2nd. SHIELD 1st-Level Abjuration Casting Time:  1  reaction, which  you take when you are  hit by an attack or targeted by the magic missile spell Range: Self Components: V, S Duration:  1 round An invisible barrier of magical force appears and protects you.

SHOCKI NG  GRASP Evocation  Cantrip Casting Time:  1 action Range: Touch Components: V, S Duration: Instantaneous Lightning springs from your hand to deliver a shock to a creature you try to touch. Make a melee spell attack against the target. You have advantage on the attack roll if the target is wearing armor made of metal. On a hit, the target takes  1d8 lightning dam­age, and it can't take reactions until the start of its next turn. The spell's damage increases by  1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8),  1 1th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8). SLEEP 1st-Level Enchantment Casting Time:  1 action Range:  90 feet Components: V, S, M (a pinch of fine sand, rose pet­als, or a cricket) Duration:  1 minute This spell sends creatures into a magical slumber. Roll 5d8; the total is how many hit points of crea­tures this spell can affect. Creatures within  20 feet of a point you choose within range are affected in ascending order of their current hit points (ignoring unconscious creatures). Starting with the creature that has the lowest cur­rent hit points, each creature affected by this spell falls unconscious until the spell ends, the sleeper takes damage, or someone uses an action to shake or slap the sleeper awake. Subtract each creature's hit  points from the total before moving on to the cr�ature with the next lowest hit points. A creature's hit points must be equal to or less than the remain­ing total for that creature to be affected. Undead and creatures immune to being charmed aren't affected by this spell. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, roll an additional 2d8 for each slot level above  1st. SPIRITUAL WEAPON 2nd-Level Evocation Casting Time:  1 bonus action Range: 60 feet Components: V, S Duration:  1 minute You create a floating,  spectral weapon within range that lasts for the duration or until you cast this spell again. When you cast the spell, you can make a me­lee spell attack against a creature within 5 feet of the  weapon.  On a hit,  the target  takes force damage equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the weapon up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. The weapon can take whatever form you choose. Clerics of deities who are associated with a partic­ular weapon (as St. Cuthbert is known for his mace and Thor for his hammer) make this spell's effect resemble that weapon. At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the dam­age increases by 1d8 for every two slot levels above the 2nd. THAUMATURGY Transmutation  Cantrip Casting Time:  1 action Range:  30 feet Components: V Duration: Up to  1 minute You manifest a minor wonder, a sign of supernatural power, within range. You create one of the following magical effects within range: •  Your voice booms up to three times as loud as nor­mal for 1 minute. •  You cause flames to flicker, brighten,  dim, or change color for 1 minute. •  You cause harmless tremors in the ground for 1 minute. •  You create an instantaneous sound that originates from a point of your choice within range, such as a rumble of thunder, the cry of a raven, or omi­nous whispers. •  You instantaneously cause an unlocked door or window to fly open or slam shut. •  You alter the appearance of your eyes for 1 minute. If you cast this spell multiple times,  you can have up to three of its  1-minute  effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action. THUNDERWAVE 1st-Level Evocation Casting Time:  1 action Range: Self (15-foot cube) Components: V, S Duration: Instantaneous A wave of thunderous force sweeps out from you. Each creature in a  15-foot cube originating from you must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 thunder damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage (round down) and isn't pushed. In addition, unsecured objects that are completely within the area of effect are automatically pushed 10 feet away from you by the spell's effect, and the spell emits a thunderous boom audible out to 300  feet. At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage in­creases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st. APPENDIX :  CONDITIONS 'A CONDITION TEMPORA RILY  A LTERS  A  CREATURES capabilities. The definitions on this page specify what happens to a creature while it is affected by a condition. Duration. A condition lasts either until it is coun­tered (the prone condition is countered by standing up, for example) or for a duration specified by the effect that imposed the condition. No Stacking.  If multiple effects impose the same condition on a creature, each instance of the condi­tion has its own duration, but the condition's effects don't get worse. A creature either has a condition or doesn't. BLI N DE D  •  A blinded creature can't see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage. C HA RME D A charmed creature can't attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magi­cal effects. The charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially with the creature. DEA FE NE D  •  A deafened creature can't hear and automatically fails any ability check that requires hearing. FRIGH TE NE D  A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight.

IT contains a complete DUNGEONS & DRAGONS adven­ture, as well as descriptions for the magic items and creatures in the adventure. It also teaches you how to run a D&D game. The rulebook that accompanies this booklet con­tains the rules for handling the situations that arise during the adventure. OVERVIEW A D&D  adventure is a collection of locations, quests, and challenges that inspire you to tell a story. The outcome of that story is determined by the actions and decisions of the adventurers-and the luck of the dice. Dragons of Stormwreck Isle draws the characters into the midst of an ancient war among dragons as they explore an island that has long been a bat­tlefield in that conflict. Here's an overview of what you'll find in this booklet: Running the Adventure. The booklet starts with an overview of the adventure. Then it takes a look at the role of the Dungeon Master in a game of D&D, and some tips to help you in this role. Adventure Sites. The four chapters of the adven­ture describe locations on Stormwreck Isle where characters can explore, interact with various crea­tures, and pursue their goals. The first site, Drag­on's Rest, serves as the characters' home base during the adventure, where they can rest and get supplies between their visits to the other sites. Magic Items and Monsters. Two appendixes describe rules for magic items and monsters that characters might find in the course of the adventure. GETTI NG STARTED To  get started, have each player choose one char­acter to play. Five characters printed on separate sheets are included in the box. Tell the players to read over the  character sheets; give their characters names; and invent the details of their characters' personality and appearance. Encourage the players to write on the character sheets to make these char­acters their own. TH E  FORGOTTEN  REALM S The Forgotten Realms is a world of high fantasy, populated by elves,  dwarves, halflings, humans, and other folk-one of many such worlds in the vast mul­tiverse of the D&D game. In the Realms, fighters dare the crypts of the fallen dwarf kings of Delzoun, seeking glory and treasure. Rogues prowl the dark alleyways of teeming cities such as Neverwinter and Baldur's Gate. Clerics in the service of gods wield mace and spell, defending against the terrifying powers that threaten the land. Wizards plunder the ruins of the fallen Netherese empire, delving into secrets too sinister for the light of day. The roads and rivers of the Realms carry min­strels and peddlers, merchants and guards, soldiers and sailors. Bold adventurers follow tales of strange, glorious, faraway places. Good maps and clear trails can take even an inexperienced youth with dreams of glory far across the world, but these paths are never safe. Travelers in the Realms face fell magic and deadly monsters. Even farms and freeholds a day's walk from a city can fall prey to monsters, and no place is safe from the wrath of a dragon. This adventure takes place on Stormwreck Isle, a small island in a region called the Sword Coast. This region is a place of adventure, where daring souls delve into ancient strongholds and explore the ruins of long-lost kingdoms. Amid a lawless wilder­ness of jagged, snow-capped peaks, alpine forests, bitter winds, and roaming monsters, the coast holds renowned bastions of civilization such as the city of Neverwinter, in the shadow of the fuming volcano known as Mount Hotenow. NUMBER OF  PLAYERS You  can  run  Dragons  of Storm wreck  Isle  for  one to five p l ayers.  If you  have four o r  five fri e n d s  ready to p l ay with yo u ,  each  p e rson  can  take  one  of the  ch ar­acters  provided  in  the box.  Five  players wi l l  fi n d  the e n co u nters  a  little easier t h a n  four p l ayers wil l ,   but the adventure works fi n e  a s  written for  gro u p s  of fo u r  or five p l ayers. I f  you  h ave fewer than  four p l ayers, you  can h ave some  p l ayers take on the  ro l e  of two  ch aracters  so the gro u p  has at least fo u r  characters. A  p l ayer with two ch aracters  s h o u l d  treat  one  of them  as their  m a i n  char­acter  a n d  the other as  a  sid e k ick, there to  h e l p  out but probably not engaging i n  a  lot of d i alogue. RU N N I N G  T H E  A DVENTURE ADVENTURE  BAC KGROUN D  According to legend, two families of dragons came into being in the very first days of the world's cre­ation. Bahamut, the noble Platinum Dragon, made the metallic dragons-gold, silver, bronze, brass, and copper. Cruel, five-headed Tiamat made the chromatic dragons-red, blue, green, black and white. The metallic and chromatic dragons share a mutual animosity that originates in the  enmity be­tween Bahamut and Tiamat. The origin of Dragon's Rest is rooted in that ani­mosity. Ages ago, a fire-breathing red dragon called Sharruth rampaged up and down the Sword Coast. Three metallic dragons joined forces to battle Shar­ruth and imprisoned her beneath the ocean floor, believing seawater would quench her fire and keep her bound forever. But Sharruth's fury, legend says, caused the undersea volcanic activity that formed Stormwreck Isle. In all likelihood, Sharruth is long dead and en­tombed beneath the island, but chromatic dragons whisper that she still lives and will one day emerge from her prison. One fact is undeniable: the pow­erful magic embodied in such an ancient dragon has left a permanent mark on Stormwreck Isle. That magic has drawn other dragons to the island throughout the centuries, making it a recurring battlefield in the conflict between chromatic and metallic dragons. Several of these dragons have died there, each leaving behind a spiritual scar that causes unpredictable magical effects. A hundred years ago, a blue dragon tried to har­ness this destructive magic. A bronze dragon named Runara pleaded with him to abandon his schemes. When he refused, Runara killed him, adding one more dragon grave to the island. Runara has grown weary of strife, and Storm­wreck Isle's wounds are a constant reminder to her of the cost of such conflict. Devoting herself to peace and reconciliation, she established the clois­ter of Dragon's Rest as a safe haven from violence. Living in human guise, Runara now serves as the leader of a tiny group of hermits and ascetics. But the ageless conflict between chromatic and metallic dragons threatens to disrupt the serenity of Dragon's Rest-and this is where the adven­ture begins! ADVENTURE  O UTLI N E  I n  Dragons of Stormwreck Isle, the characters expe­rience the magical scars left behind by the death of dragons. Faced with the evil schemes of one living dragon and the righteous anger of another, they'll have the chance to explore whether peace between the feuding dragon families is possible-or if they must resort to violence to resolve the conflict on this isle. This adventure has four chapters: Chapter 1,  "Dragon's Rest," introduces Runara's cloister and its inhabitants and provides the char­acters the opportunity to learn about the problems facing the island. It also describes additional encounters you can use in the course of the adven­ture, including a magical hot spring with mysteri­ous guardians at the site of a brass dragon's death. Chapter 2, "Seagrow Caves," describes how the grave of Sharruth spawns magical connections to the Elemental Plane of Fire that threaten a com­munity of mushroom-like myconids. Chapter 3, "Cursed Shipwreck," details a ship that crashed alongside the bones of a gold dragon and the horrible curse within the ship's hold. Chapter 4,  "Clifftop Observatory," brings the char­acters to the site where Runara killed a blue dragon-and where that blue dragon's grandson has made his lair. There they'll also find a bronze wyrmling who rejected Runara's teachings of peace, now held prisoner in the blue dragon's lair. ADVENTURE  M APS  The maps i n  this booklet are for the DM's eyes only. These maps show secret  doors  and  other elements the players aren't meant to see. When the characters arrive at a location marked on a map, describe it to give them a clear mental picture of the location. You can also draw what they see on paper, copying what's on your map while omitting secret details. It's not important that your hand-drawn map perfectly match what's in the printed adventure. Try to get the basic shape and dimensions correct and leave the rest to the players' imaginations. TH E  D UNGEON  MASTER The Dungeon Master has a special role i n  D&D games. The DM is a storyteller. The DM presents the challenges and encounters that the characters must overcome. The DM is the players' interface to the D&D world, who reads (and sometimes also writes) the adventure and describes what happens in re­sponse to the characters' actions. The DM is a referee. When it's not clear what ought to happen next, the DM  decides how to apply the rules and keep the story going. The DM is a roleplayer. The DM plays the mon­sters in the adventure, choosing their actions and rolling dice for their attacks. The DM also plays all the other people the characters meet, including helpful ones. DM  TI P S  The most important part of being a good DM is facil­itating the fun of everyone at the table. Keep these tips in mind to help things go smoothly: Embrace the shared story.  D&D is about telling a story as a group, so let the players contribute to the outcome through the words and deeds of their characters. If some players are reluctant to speak up, ask them what their characters are doing. It's not a competition. The DM isn't competing against the player characters. Your job is to referee the rules, run monsters, and keep the story moving. Be fair and flexible. Treat your players in a fair, im­partial manner. The rules help you do this, but you can make your own rulings to ensure everyone is having fun. Modify the adventure to suit your tastes. The ad­venture has no prescribed outcome. You can alter any encounter to make it more interesting and fun for your players. Keep a notepad handy. Use it to track details such as the characters'  and monsters' initiative order. SHARING  I NFORMATION As Dungeon Master, one of your most important tasks is figuring out how much to tell the players and when. All the information the players need to make choices comes from you. Within the rules of the game and the limits of the characters' knowl­edge and senses, tell players everything they need to know. RU N N I N G  T H E  A DV E NTU R E  Text t h at  a p pears  i n  a  b o x  l i ke t h i s  i s   meant t o  be read a l o u d   or  para p hrased to the  p l ayers  when their characters first arrive  at a  location  or  u n d er  a  s pecific circ u m s t a n ce, a s  d es cribed  i n  the text.  I t  u s u a l ly  de­scribes  locatio ns or presents scripted  d i a l o g u e ,  s o  the p l ayers  know what's  up  a n d  have a  s e n s e  of what their characters'  options are. You don't have to reveal every aspect of a situation or hazard in one go. Boxed text typically describes everything the characters see, hear, or smell at first glance. As characters search rooms, make Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation) checks, open drawers and chests, and generally examine things more closely, give players more details about what their characters find. Creature Stat Blocks. Whenever the adventure text presents a creature's name ip. bold type, that's a visual cue directing you to the creature's stat block in appendix B.  Those stat blocks are intended for your eyes only. However, as the characters fight monsters, you can reveal certain information to help them make smart choices in combat: Hit Points. You can give players a sense of how well they're doing against a creature by describ­ing, in narrative terms, how hurt the creature is. For example, if the creature has fewer than half its hit points remaining, you can describe it as being badly wounded. Such information gives the players a sense of progress and might spur them to press the attack. On the other hand, if the char­acters aren't damaging the creature much, let the players know that the creature looks like it can take a lot more punishment. That might encour­age the players to change their plan. Abilities, Strengths, and Weaknesses. As they fight a creature, characters should learn more about the creature's abilities. Share information with the players as it becomes apparent. For ex­ample, if the wizard casts flaming sphere (a spell that deals fire damage) against a fire snake (a crea­ture that's immune to fire damage), let the wiz­ard's player know the spell doesn't seem to bother the creature at all. Players might correctly guess that a fire snake probably isn't harmed by fire; feel free to subtly confirm their guesses (perhaps smil­ing and saying, "That sounds reasonable"). Story Information. A location description might include important information not in boxed text. Often you're meant to reveal such information when the characters examine particular areas or interact with creatures. STORMWRECK ISLE M A P   , :  5 T O R M W R E C K  ls L E  As the DM, you roleplay the creatures that the characters encounter. The adventure offers guid­ance to help you decide what these creatures know and how willing they are to share  information with the characters. Beyond that, improvise and bring these creatures to life as best you can. For exam­ple, the adventure describes Runara (the disguised bronze dragon who leads the cloister of Dragon's Rest) as wise and peace-loving, but you get to decide what her voice sounds like and how she reacts to a given situation. You can also ignore what the text says and roleplay Runara or any other creature as you see fit. Treasure.  When characters find treasure, tell them how many coins they find and how much any gems and art objects are worth.  Sometimes treasure includes magic items, whose names are presented in italic type. Appendix A describes these items and their properties, as well as the rules for how characters figure out what a magic item does. MAKING MISTAKES Dungeon Masters are fallible, just like everyone else, and even experienced DMs make mistakes. If you overlook, forget, or misrepresent something, correct yourself and move on. No one expects you to memorize every part of this adventure and  all the rules in the rulebook. As long as your players are having fun, everything will be just fine. IMPROVISING ABILITY  CHECKS The adventure often tells you what ability checks characters might try in certain situations and the Difficulty Class (DC) of those checks. But some­times characters try things that the adventure can't anticipate. In that case, you decide how to handle it. Ability checks are for situations where a charac­ter's success or failure isn't guaranteed. If anyone can easily accomplish a task,  don't ask for an abil­ity check. Just tell the player what happens. And if there's no way anyone could accomplish the task, just tell the player it doesn't work. When you decide an ability check is required, con­sult the "Ability Checks" section of the rulebook and the table of Typical Difficulty Classes. Most of the time, choose a DC that is easy (DC  10), moderate (DC  1 5), or hard (DC 20). RUN N I N G  T H E  ADVENTURE CHAPTER  1 DRAGON'S  REST THE ADVENTURE BEGINS AT A TINY CLOISTER CALLED Dragon's  Rest, a haven where world-weary people come to seek peace, reconciliation, and enlighten­ment. There, the characters learn about the dangers facing Stormwreck Isle. Each character has a specific reason for coming to the cloister, as shown on the character sheets. You can also let players invent their own reasons for their characters to  seek out Runara's wisdom and assistance. WELC OME TO  DRAGON'S RE ST Read the following text when you're ready to start: Yo u r  jo u rney was  u n eventfu l ,  b u t  t h e  i s l a n d  now v i s i b l e  off the  bow  promises  rare won d e r s .

They point to  the  base of the path  a n d  wish you  good  l u c k  before they row back to  the  s h i p.  Yo u r  visit to  Dragon's  Rest  begi n s !  Before continuing with the adventure, encourage the players to introduce their characters to each other if they haven't done so already. They might want to discuss their reasons for visiting Dragon's Rest, or they might prefer to keep their reasons se­cret for now. If they have any questions about what they can see of the cloister from the boat, use map 2 (on page 1 1) and the information in "Dragon's Rest Locations" to answer them. Ask the players to give you the party's marching order as they start toward the cloister. Who's in front, and who's bringing up the rear? Make a note of this marching order. When you're ready, continue with the "Drowned Sailors" section. D ROWNE D   SAILORS Read the following text to start the encounter: As yo u ' re  about to  leave t h e  beach  a n d  start yo u r  c l i m b, y o u  h e a r  a  ruckus o f  s p l a s h i n g  a n d  a wet,  g u r­g l i n g  moan  b e h i n d  you. Th ree fi g u res  a re  s h a m b l i n g  u p  fro m  the water's edge, a b o u t  t h i rty feet  away. They're  d ressed  as  s a i l ors,  but  t h e i r  s k i n   is  gray a n d  t h e y  look d rowned. Sea water d rools from  t h e i r  s l ack mouths  as they l u rch toward you. The three shambling sailors are zombies, the ani­mated corpses of sailors who died in a recent ship­wreck. The characters face a choice: they can turn and fight the zombies, or they can continue up the path and leave the slow, shambling zombies behind. If the characters turn and fight, this is the first combat encounter in the adventure. Here are the steps you should follow to run it: 1 .  Review the zombie stat block in appendix B. 2. Use the initiative rules in the rulebook to de­termine who acts first, second, third, and so on. Keep track of everyone's initiative count on your notepad. 3. On the zombies' initiative count, they move to­ward the characters. If they get close enough, theymake melee attacks. The zombies' stat block con­tains the information you need to resolve theseattacks. If all the characters are more than 20 feetaway, the zombies use the Dash action so theycan move farther. For more information on whatthe zombies can do on their turn, see "Combat" inthe rulebook.4. The zombies fight until they're all defeated.Tip:  Undead Fortitude.  The zombies' UndeadFortitude trait reflects how hard it is to kill these walking corpses. When this trait prevents a zombie from dying, give the players a hint about what hap­pened. You might say, "That should have finished the creature off, but it refuses to stop moving!" On the flip side, any time a zombie takes radiant dam­age (such as from the cleric's sacred flame cantrip), you might describe the creature howling in agony. This can help the players realize that radiant dam­age is a way to get around Undead Fortitude. If the players ask whether their characters know anything about fighting zombies, have them make DC 10 In­telligence checks. Those who succeed might recall that a particularly powerful blow (a critical hit) or radiant damage can help finish off a zombie. Runara's Aid. In the unlikely event that the zom­bies defeat the adventurers, Runara comes to their rescue. The characters wake up in the temple (area AS in Dragon's Rest). Runara explains that she heard the sounds of combat and arrived just in time to prevent the zombies from dragging the characters into the sea. Avoiding the Zombies.  If the characters decide not to fight the zombies, they easily escape from the slow, shambling monsters. The zombies don't follow them up the path toward Dragon's Rest. The char­acters will have another opportunity to deal with the zombies later (see "Cloister Quests" later in this chapter). M E ETING T H E   I N H A BITANTS Read this text when the characters first climb the path to Dragon's Rest: Your a rrival q u i c k l y  d raws  the  atte ntion of the  entire po p u l ation  of the  pl ace-which  co n s i sts  mostly of kobo l d s .

"Why a re you  h e re?"  a n d   more  that a re  lost i n  the d i n .  Visitors to the cloister are rare, and the kobolds' cu­riosity is insatiable; they keep asking questions until the characters insist they stop. When the characters quiet the kobolds (or if the players start showing signs of exasperation), the leader of the cloister approaches to welcome the characters. Read the following text: C HA PT E R  1  I  D RAGON'S  R E ST The  ch atte r i n g  kobolds fa l l  s i l e n t  as  a  new  fi g u re co mes  i nto view,  d esce n d i n g  gracefu l ly from t h e  u p p e r  p a rt o f  the c l o i ster.  S h e's  a n  e l d e r l y  h u m a n  woman with weathered  brown  s k i n ,  wh ite h a i r  i n  tight b r a i d s ,   and  kindly  h azel eyes, d ressed  i n  a  s i m p l e  wh ite  robe.  S h e  s m i l es  a s  she d raws  n e a r  and exte n d s  h e r  a r m s   i n  greet i n g. "We lcome to  D ragon's  Rest,"  s h e  says.  " M ay  B a h a ­mut's g u i d a nce  lead you to whatever you  see k." This is Elder Runara, the leader of Dragon's Rest. If the characters defeated the zombies at the beach, she thanks them for their service to the cloister. Even if they did not fight the zombies, she tells them they're welcome to stay at Dragon's Rest as long as they wish, sleeping either in one of the monastic cells (area Al) or in the temple (area AS) and eating with the rest of the community in the dining room (area A3). Runara says nothing about payment of any kind. If the characters offer to give money or perform services around the  cloister in exchange for her hospitality, she accepts these gifts. Throughout this adventure, Dragon's Rest serves as a home base for the characters. All the places they'll explore on the island are within a few miles of the cloister, and they can return here whenever they wish to rest, heal, and get information they need for the next part of their adventures. In addi­tion, they can buy any of the equipment described in the rulebook from Myla (see "Kobolds"). During their time at Dragon's Rest, the characters can interact with any of its residents. All the resi­dents but Runara live in the small monastic cells cut into the cliff face (area Al  on the cloister map). ELDER  RU NARA Elder Runara is the leader of Dragon's Rest. She appears as a human woman, but she is actually an adult bronze dragon disguised in human form. She guides the residents of the cloister in their contem­plation and study. The cloister's inhabitants know Runara's true identity, but they do not speak of it to visitors. Runara's initial attitude toward the characters is indifferent (see "Social Interaction" in the rulebook). She becomes friendly as soon as the characters demonstrate that they care about the cloister's safety, such as by fighting the zombies at the beach or undertaking any of the quests she offers them (see "Cloister Quests" later in this chapter). If the characters harm any of the residents of Dragon's Rest, she becomes hostile and insists the characters make amends for the harm they did before she is willing to deal with them in any way. C H AP T E R  1  I  D RAGON'S  R E ST Runara's mission is to help those whose lives have been shaped by violence find new paths  forward in peace. Ultimately, she would like to see chromatic and metallic dragons find a peaceful way to coexist in the world. In the meantime, she finds comfort in helping humans and other people escape from cy­cles of violence. Runara maintains a secret lair in a cave accessed by an undersea tunnel, a short distance from the cloister and not shown on the map of Dragon's Rest. She is careful not to enter or leave the cave when anyone might spot her, and she enters and emerges from the water in the open  ocean,  out of sight of the cloister. The other residents of the cloister think she lives in the temple at the top of the island (area AS), or they simply laugh away queries about her accom­modations, explaining that she's always in the tem­ple, or in the library, or checking on the rest of the residents-she never seems to sleep! KOBOLDS Kobolds are small reptilian Humanoids who believe they are descended from dragons and gravitate to the service of dragons.  Over the centuries, many bands of kobolds have been  drawn to Stormwreck Isle by the lingering draconic magic that suffuses the island.  Nine kobolds utterly devoted to Runara now live at Dragon's Rest. The kobolds of Dragon's Rest are lawful good, sharing Runara's ideals of justice and compassion. Since they are sensitive to sunlight, they work at night and avoid moving about during the day. Unless otherwise noted, the kobolds are initially friendly toward the adventurers. The kobolds are summarized below. They can provide comic relief, offer a down-to-earth perspec­tive, or be a way for you to pass hints to the players if they're having trouble putting things together. But don't feel like you need to bring all nine of these kobolds to life! Pick one or two of these kobolds that you and the characters like the most and let them be the focus of the characters' interactions with the kobolds: Agga speaks little and has no patience for non­sense. She keeps the rest of the kobolds organized and in line. She is indifferent toward visitors, but if the characters show respect for the cloister and help keep the more rambunctious kobolds in line, her attitude improves to friendly. Blepp has a sharp danger sense and is convinced he's supernaturally lucky. His prized possession is an ordinary dagger he claims is magical. Frub has limitless energy and desperately needs help finding productive directions to channel it. He loves to ask questions about everything other people are doing. EVER S I NC E   AN  U NF O R T U N A T E   I NCID E N T   IN  T H E  l< I TC H E N,  LAYLEE  IS  N O   L O N G E R  ALLOWED  T O  H A ND L E   MYLA'S  ALC H E M IC A L  F I RE. Kilnip has terrible insomnia and sleeps only a few hours each day. She is always tired but an eager conversationalist. Laylee has a curious mind and a talent for tools and building. She serves as Myla's helper. Mumpo is so audaciously courageous that he stole a copper piece from Runara's hoard.  He's convinced she has no  idea. (He is wrong, but Runara finds the situation amusing and lets Mumpo continue to believe in her ignorance.) Myla (lawful good kobold tinkerer) is a winged kobold whose brothers, Mek and Minn, now fol­low Sparkrender, the blue wyrmling in Clifftop Observatory (see chapter 4). When Myla's wings were badly injured in an attack by stirges (which she describes as "hungry, icky, blood-sucking, bat­things"), Runara helped in her recovery. Now Myla spends her time experimenting with alchemy,  en­gineering, and magic. Rix is pious and tends to the temple, acting as Runara's assistant. She adores puns. Rix recently witnessed a ship crashing on the rocks to the north (see "Cloister Quests" later in this chapter). Zark is rude and fond of colorful insults. His fa­vorites are  "Eat my sword, bugbear breath!" and "Your father was a gas spore!" He is indifferent toward visitors. TARAK Tarak is a human man in late middle age. He has pale skin tanned darker with many freckles, auburn hair and a beard that is mostly gray, and gray-blue eyes. Faded tattoos in an abstract design peek up the side of his neck from beneath his dirt­stained robes. An avid botanist, Tarak tends the cloister's garden plots, growing flowers, herbs, and vegetables. He is soft spoken and helpful, eager to share his knowl­edge of herbalism. But his kindly demeanor belies his past as a ruthless poisoner for a thieves' guild. After his work led to the death of his lover, he fled the guild and plans to spend the rest of his life aton­ing for his past evils. Tarak is initially friendly toward visitors, but if a character pries into his past,  his attitude shifts­first to indifferent, then to hostile if the character continues to push. When he's hostile, his demeanor becomes cold and clipped, and he avoids the charac­ters if he can. A gold hangman's noose is worked into the design of Tarak's visible tattoos. A character who studies the tattoos and succeeds on a DC  1 5  Intelligence (History) check recognizes the mark as a symbol associated with the Gilded Gallows, a thieves' guild that operates in a country far to the southeast called Elturgard. A character with the criminal back­ground automatically succeeds on this check. Tarak does not willingly discuss the details of his past with anyone but trusted friends. Tarak frequently visits the sea caves on the south side of the island to acquire heart cap mushrooms from the myconids that live there. He uses the mushrooms to make potions of healing. But the my­conids have  installed a fearsome guardian at their caves-a fungus-covered octopus monster-that has turned him away on his latest visits, and he is wor­ried  (see  "Cloister Quests"). VARNOTH Varnoth is a human woman whose frame, once tightly muscled, has thinned with age. Her black hair is cropped close to her scalp, and her light brown skin bears many scars-one of which runs across her left eye, which is milky and blind. An ele­gant prosthetic made from wood and metal replaces her right leg below the knee. Varnoth was a feared general at the head of a mer­cenary company called the Azure Wolves. Age and battle have taken a toll on her, and she is spending her twilight years in reflective contemplation at Dragon's Rest. Her demeanor is gruff, but she is ob­servant and empathetic. Above all, Varnoth believes in second  chances and redemption. Varnoth has a set of mason's tools that she uses to maintain the temple and other areas of the cloister. C H A PT E R  1  I  D RAGON'S  R E ST While working in the temple recently, she witnessed a ship change course and crash into the rocks to the north (see "Cloister Quests"). Varnoth is indifferent to visitors, but a character can shift her attitude to friendly by engaging her in conversation on her favorite topics: history, ethics, and the impact of individual actions on the world. A character who learns Varnoth's name and succeeds on a DC  1 5  Intelligence (History) check recalls hearing of General Varnoth Wender and the Azure Wolves, which was a mighty force in the east about a decade ago. A character with the soldier background succeeds on this check automatically. D RAGON'S  R E ST  LO CATIONS The following locations are keyed to map 2, which shows the layout of Dragon's Rest. Al :  PATH  A N D  MONASTIC  CELLS A  l o n g  path  leads fro m  t h e  rocky s h o re  up  t h e  s i d e  o f  t h e  c l i ff, w i t h  occa s i o n a l  s t a i r s  t o  ease the  ascent.

The star-in-a-circle symbol on the map represents the dragon statue. A character who examines the statue  and succeeds on a DC  10 In­telligence (Arcana) check recognizes that it depicts a bronze dragon-a member of the metallic family. If characters ask Runara about the statue, she  tells them it depicts Astalagan, who died on these cliffs centuries ago. She doesn't tell them that Astalagan was her father. Cells.  The doorways lead into simple monastic cells occupied by the cloister residents. Each cell is furnished with a bed, a nightstand, a small desk, and a chair. The westernmost cell is vacant, and it is available to the characters if they don't mind  sharing the space. Next to it is Tarak's cell, then Varnoth's. The fourth cell is Myla's, cluttered with junk and tools. The fifth and sixth cells are strung with hammocks, offering space for the other eight kobolds to sleep. A2 :  WINCH HOUSE A  s m a l l ,  free-stand i n g  b u i l d i n g  h a lfway  u p  the  path has a  peaked  roof and  a weathered wood e n  door. A stu rdy wood e n   p a l l et wra p p ed  with  rope  h a n gs  be­neath t h e  b u i l d i n g  on  a n   i ron c h a i n ,   lying flat agai nst the cliff face. Inside the building is a winch that allows the pallet to be lowered down to the water, 50 feet below. When boats deliver supplies to the cloister, the  residents use this pallet to haul goods both up and down. A lever locks the winch in place. If a character pulls the lever, the pallet falls down to the water and floats there. As an action, a character can operate the winch to pull the pallet back up  10 feet. A3 :  KITCHEN A  doorway  in  the  rock o p e n s  i nto  a  d i n i n g  room with a  long t a b l e .

A  s h o rt  h a l l ­way co n n ects t o  a  s m a l l ,  t i d y  kitc h e n .  The cloister residents share three daily meals here. They take turns cooking and cleaning up after meals. Nobody says it out loud, but the days when Tarak cooks are everyone's favorite. A4 :  LIBRARY Of a l l  t h e  doo rways  cut i nto the cliff face,  only o n e  h a s  a n  actual  door. T h i s  entry's d o o r  i s  m a d e  of stu rdy  oak  with  i ron  b a n d s ,   and  it swings open e a s i l y  to  reveal  a  s pacious  l i bra ry.

The cloister library holds books and scrolls cover­ing a variety of topics, but focused on theology and history.  Runara spends nearly  half her time  in here, studying, copying, and annotating the library's col­lection. Tarak and Varnoth also come here to read and discuss various works. Many of the kobolds visit as well, but mostly for the quiet; only Myla could be described as studious. M A P   2:  DRAGO N'S  REST A5:  TEMPLE  OF  BAHAM UT The h i g h est  point of the cloister is crowned  by  an o p e n - a i r  te m p l e  that  overhangs the c l i ff,  s u p po rted by  arched  sto n e  struts  a n chored to the c l i ff  face. The north wa l l  of the te m p le is  carved  d i rect l y  i nto t h e  rock, w h i l e  t h e  rest is open to t h e  sea a i r.  Heavy  p i l l a rs m a r k  the th ree o p e n   s i des,  s u p po rt i n g  the woo d e n  roof.  I n  the center o f  the te m p l e  stands a  sto ne  statu e  o f  a  k i n d -loo k i n g  o l d   m a n  with  c a n a ries  perched  onh i s   hands,  s h o u l d ers,  and  head. A  fee l i n g  of seren ity suffuses the p l ace. The temple is very simple, with the statue (repre­sented by the star-in-a-circle symbol on the map) as its only furnishing. The statue depicts Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon, in mortal disguise, surrounded by seven canaries that represent gold dragons who accompany him on his travels. A character who examines the statue and succeeds on a DC  10 In­telligence (Religion) check recognizes Bahamut, and any resident of Dragon's Rest identifies the god if asked. Depressions in the statue's pedestal at the four cardinal directions hold offerings of incense made to Bahamut. Runara spends about half her time here, tending and maintaining the temple, offering prayers and incense, or in quiet contemplation. Other residents of the cloister help her, most often Varnoth and the kobold Rix. The feeling of serenity that pervades the temple is the result of protective magic. A non-evil creature who makes a saving throw within the temple can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the saving throw. If a character casts detect magic in the tem­ple, the spell reveals a faint aura around the statue. Runara is the only inhabitant of Dragon's Rest who knows that this is a lingering effect of the death of a dragon on this site-her father, Astalagan. About Bahamut.  Known as the Platinum Dragon, Bahamut is the patron and progenitor of metallic dragons. Adventurers and dragons alike pray to Bahamut to uphold honor and justice, or when they need courage to face a great threat. He seldom in­terferes in the affairs of mortal creatures, though he makes exceptions to help thwart the machinations of Tiamat the Dragon Queen and the evil dragons that serve her. CHAPTER  1  \  DRAGON'S  R E ST C LO I STER QUE STS As the characters explore Dragon's Rest, the resi­dents talk with them about the problems the cloister is facing. These conversations are opportunities for you to introduce the players to the adventures that await them in the sea caves, the shipwreck, and the ancient observatory. This adventure is designed to be flexible and give the  players the sense that they're in charge of their destiny on Stormwreck Isle. Ideally, the characters will spend time at Dragon's Rest and then explore both Seagrow Caves (described in chapter 2) and the wreck of Compass Rose (chapter 3). They can choose where to go first. After they've explored both of those sites, they should be ready to face Sparkrender in the  Clifftop Observatory (chapter 4). Each character sheet includes a personal goal for that character. Some  of those goals are concrete­the wizard, for example, is eager to learn the secrets of Cliff top Observatory. Others are more general and might be fulfilled gradually over the course of the adventure-both the paladin and the fighter gaining a better understanding of their role in the world, for example. Use those goals (described un­der "Individual Quests" below) to help the players bring their characters to life as they interact with Runara and the other residents of Dragon's Rest. Z O M B I E   RE S URGE N C E  If the adventurers did not fight the zombies when they first arrived on the island, the zombies cause trouble later. After the characters have spent some time at the cloister, they hear cries for help. Read the following text: Two  res i d ents  of D ragon's  Rest  a re  r u n n i n g  for t h e i r  l ives  u p  t h e  l ower p a t h ,  t h e i r  fi s h i n g  e q u i p m e n t  d i s ­carded  b e h i n d  t h e m .   B l ood a n d  d i rt  stain t h e i r  ro bes. If the characters talk to Runara about the zom­bies, she tells them she suspects a wrecked ship off the rocks to the north is the source of these mon­sters, and she asks the characters to investigate the site (see "Shipwreck" below). MORE  ZOMBIES If the characters defeated the zombies when they first arrived on the island, you can use this encoun­ter at any point during the adventure to add a little extra combat spice to the characters' lives. If the characters have already reached 2nd level, you can use from four to six zombies to give them a good challenge. SEA C AV E S  Tarak is eager t o  reestablish contact with the myco­nids of the sea caves. He asks the  characters to visit the caves, find out what's wrong with the myconids, and bring him back some heart cap mushrooms. He warns them about the fungal octopus the myconids have created as a guardian and tells them they'll probably have to fight the creature to gain access to the caves. He also gives them a foul-smelling sack of food scraps they can give the myconids as a gesture of friendship. Finally, he gives them two potions of healing (described in appendix A). S H I PWRE C K  Several ships have recently crashed on the rocks north of Dragon's Rest and sunk with no survivors, and a few days ago both Varnoth and the kobold Rix witnessed the most recent wreck. They saw the ship abruptly veer off course and crash into the rocks, and they suggest the characters might help the is­land by discovering what caused the crash. If the characters ask Runara about it, she suggests that the answer is likely to be found on an older wreck­the wreck of Compass Rose. T h re e  fi g u res  s h a m b l e  after them-bloated  corpses IND IVIDUA L  U E STS d ressed  as  s a i lors,  m o a n i n g  and  g u rg l i n g .  The characters have another opportunity to fight the three zombies,  this time with the lives of two new acquaintances-Blepp the kobold and Tarak the human gardener-hanging in the balance. See "Drowned Sailors" for help getting the encoun­ter started. Blepp has 2 hit points left after a zombie hit him, and he is convinced that his good luck and his "mag­ical" dagger saved him from certain death. Tarak is unarmed, and the zombies overpower both him and Blepp if the characters don't help. As described on the character sheets, the characters have their own reasons for visiting Dragon's Rest. THE  CLERIC The cleric was led here by a recurring dream involv­ing the shadow of death. If the character talks to Runara about the dream or their quest, Runara lis­tens closely, then pauses to think. "Well," she says, "I am no expert on interpreting dreams, but perhaps the zombies you fought are the 'hunger of death' you spoke of." She points the character toward the wreck of Compass Rose (see "Shipwreck" above) to investigate further. C HA P T E R  1  I  D R AG ON'S  R E ST THE  FIGHTER The fighter has come to Dragon's Rest in the hope that Runara can help the character understand the sense of destiny that weighs on their shoulders. If the character talks to Runara about this on first arriving at the cloister, Runara invites the character to consider how their reaction to the zombies on the beach might reflect their destiny-or not. If the char­acter talks to Runara after having completed one or more of the adventure's quests, she encourages the character to consider whether their heroic actions might be the first manifestations of that destiny taking shape. At the end of the adventure, Runara encourages the character to continue on their path: "If your destiny is not clear to you yet, I'm confident it soon will be." THE  PALADIN Disillusioned with the corruption of Neverwinter, the paladin comes to Dragon's Rest seeking rest and new resolve. Runara welcomes the character and encourages them to talk to Tarak and Varnoth, who both know about escaping lives of corruption and violence. She also encourages the paladin to spend time in the temple of Bahamut. At the end of the adventure, she asks the paladin if they have learned anything about how to live in a world plagued with such corruption. If the character has no answer, she suggests, "Perhaps your adven­tures here have shown you a way to combat evil on your own terms. Perhaps other such adventures await you." THE  ROGUE The rogue comes to Dragon's Rest in search of a lost fortune supposedly secreted away on the island by a member of the Gilded Gallows. The thieves' guild member in question is Tarak, who did in fact betray the guild, though the story has been twisted in the retelling. Tarak's last assignment for the guild RU NARA SAV E S  TH E  DAY!

The two tried to flee Elturgard  together, but his lover was killed by another assassin. Tarak escaped, but no treasure was involved. If the  rogue  asks him  about it, he explains he has left the life of crime-and sug­gests perhaps it's time for the rogue to do the same. THE WIZARD The wizard carries a letter from a colleague about lost knowledge held in the Clifftop Observatory (see chapter 4). If asked about the observatory, Runara says, "Many have sought the knowledge contained in that place. I can direct you there, but first you need to show me you are worthy." She promises to direct the wizard to the observatory after the characters help deal with the other problems on the island. L O ST WYRMLING When the characters have proven themselves trust­worthy and competent by dealing with the zombies, the myconids, and the shipwreck, Runara decides it's time to confide in them. She summons them to the temple (area AS). Read the following text when the characters arrive: E l d e r  R u n a ra  s m i l es  as  you  a p p roach .  " I  have  some­thing to  s h ow y o u ,"  s h e  says .  T h e re's  a  A a s h   l i ke  a s i l e nt stroke of l i g h t n i n g ,  a n d  t h e  h u m a n  woman is gone.

"As  yo u  have  d i scovered, t h i s  i s l a nd  has  m a ny  old wo u n d s .  And  I ' m  afra i d  the cyc le of violence  i s   sta rt­i n g  a g a i n .   I  have  one  m o re favor to  ask  you." Runara outlines the  history summarized in the "Ad­venture Background" section and explains that each site the characters visited is linked to the death of a dragon. Then she tells them that a bronze wyrmling named Aidron came to the island a few months ago and studied with her at Dragon's Rest. Five days before the characters' arrival, he argued with her, angrily rejected her teaching of peace, and stormed away from the cloister. She fears he went to the an­cient observatory on the southeast side of the island, which is another dragon's final resting place. She suspects some evil has arisen there, but says she dares not go there herself, lest her presence reopen old wounds. She gives them a moonstone key-a 3-inch-long,  1-inch-wide hexagonal prism made from moonstone, with a dragon's head engraved on one end-and explains that they'll need it to access the observatory. CHAPTER 1  I  D R AGON ' S  R E STEXPLORI NG THE  I SLAN D  This adventure presents Dragon's Rest and three adventure locations in detail, but Stormwreck Isle holds the possibility of excitement and danger beyond those sites. While the characters travel between locations on the island, or if they set out to explore the island, they might stumble across fantastical creatures and locations that provide an extra challenge on their journey. ADDITIONAL E N C OU NTERS Place these encounters wherever you want to on the island, or use them as inspiration as you begin to craft your own adventures. HOT SPRINGS  HAVOC This encounter poses a simple challenge for charac­ters of 2nd level or higher,  or a harder challenge for 1 st-level characters.  It's particularly appropriate if the characters are rowing around the island or mak­ing their way along the coast at sea level. B i l lowi n g  c l o u d s  of ste a m  e m e rge from  the  rocks a h e a d ,  a n d  the  a i r  grows t h i cker with  m o i st u re .

Not immediately visible to the characters are the guardians of the spring: three fume drakes. These mischievous creatures are initially indifferent to the characters and ignore their arrival, but if anyone attempts to gather mushrooms or enter the water of the hot spring, the fume drakes become hostile, emerging from the water to attack the group. A character who examines the water and succeeds on a DC  1 0  Wisdom (Perception) check spots the shim­mering outlines of the fume drakes in the water. Spring  Waters.  The spring is the site of a brass dragon's death, and life-giving magic persists at the site. A character who spends  10 minutes bathing in the waters of the spring can roll one of their Hit Dice (noted on each character sheet) and regain hit points equal to the roll plus their Constitution mod­ifier. A character can benefit from bathing in the hot spring at most once per day. Treasure.  A character who examines the mush­rooms lining the spring and succeeds on a DC 1 5  Intelligence (Nature) check identifies these mush­rooms as wind spores-a rare fungus with a unique magical property. When a creature squeezes a wind C H A PTER 1  I  D RAGON'S  R E ST spore mushroom's cap, it releases a small  cloud of spores. For  1  hour, the creature doesn't need to breathe, as the spores provide it with oxygen. A wind spore is worth 30 gp, and at any given time 2d4 wind spores are ready to be harvested. THERE ,  THERE ,  0WLBEAR This encounter poses a medium challenge for 3rd­level characters and a difficult challenge for 2nd­level characters. Use it if your group enjoys combat or the players need a chance to practice using their characters' new abilities after gaining a level. It's particularly appropriate if the characters are travel­ing across the island rather than following the coast. A  d i scord a n t  sou nd-half a  low growl,  h a l f  a  piercing screech-rips t h ro u g h  t h e  a i r.  Abru ptly,  a  h u l ki n g  creature comes  i nto v i ew.  A  m i x  o f  p u r p l e  feathers  a n d  d ee p  b rown  fu r covers  i t s  b e a r l i ke  body,  a n d  i t s  l a rge eyes  stare h u ngrily at you from  its owl ish  head. This owlbear is hostile toward the characters. It views them as intruders in its territory, though its goal is to drive them away rather than kill them. Originally a part of a performing troupe, the owl­bear was stranded here after the ship carrying the troupe crashed on the northern rocks. Any character within 5 feet of the owlbear notices a small wooden whistle hanging around its neck. This whistle was (and still can be) used to train and command the owlbear. A character within 5 feet of the owlbear can use their action to attempt to grab the whistle. If the character succeeds on a DC 1 2  Strength check, the whistle comes free. With the whistle in hand, a character can take an action to blow into it and make a DC 1 0  Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. On a success, the owlbear calms and immediately becomes friendly toward the whistle  holder and indifferent toward the other characters. However, it won't leave the area it now considers its territory, and any attempt to force it to leave makes it hostile again. KOBOLD  RENEGADES This encounter is a difficult challenge for  1st-level characters and can be scaled up for 2nd- or 3rd-level characters as noted below. It's appropriate whenever characters are traveling around the island by land. A group of kobolds tries to ambush the charac­ters. They're hiding in the rocks and light foliage, hoping to get the jump on the adventurers. Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check for the kobolds, rolling once for all of them and using the Dexterity modifier (+2) of the wingless kobolds. Compare the result to the characters' passive Wisdom (Perception) scores. Any character whose score is lower than the kobolds'  check result is surprised and loses their turn during the first round of combat (see "Surprise" in the rulebook).

These cruel, vicious kobolds reject both the peaceful teaching of Runara and the tyrannical rule of Sparkrender, and they prey on travelers who stray away from Dragon's Rest. They haven't had much success and are des­perate, so they're hostile and fight to the death. Their desperation means that they can easily be persuaded to stop fighting with an offer of money or food. Otherwise, they're not interested in conversa­tion or negotiation. 2nd-Level  Characters.  If the characters are 2nd level, use six kobolds and two winged kobolds. 3rd-Level  Characters.  If the characters are 3rd level, use eight kobolds and three winged kobolds. WHAT  LIES  B E N E ATH As described in  the  "Adventure Background" section in the introduction, Stormwreck Isle was formed from magic-fueled volcanic activity in the tomb of a monstrous red dragon named Sharruth. Some legends and rumors suggest Sharruth is not actually dead, merely imprisoned beneath the island, and the activity in Seagrow Caves suggests that all is not well beneath Stormwreck Isle. You can devise your own adventures around char­acters investigating Sharruth's tomb. Characters might scour the island until they find hidden vents they can use to access winding tunnels leading deep into the earth. More fume drakes and fire snakes might lurk below. Perhaps there's even a group of kobolds who serve mighty Sharruth. Such an adventure is yours to devise, and you can put your unique spin on what the characters do and discover there. Of course, if you're not ready to craft an expedition into the caverns beneath the island, then the characters simply don't discover those subterranean passages no matter how much they search. C H A PT E R  1  I  DRAGON'S  R E ST CHAPTER  2 SEAGROW  CAVES Turs CHAPTER ASSUMES THE  CHARACTERS  COME here before going to the wreck of Compass Rose, and they are still  1 st level. It also includes sim­ple instructions to scale up the danger in combat encounters if the characters complete chapter 3, "Cursed Shipwreck," before coming here, and are now 2nd level. C AV E S   OVERVIEW The sea caves on the southwest side of Storm­wreck Isle are inhabited by an unusual colony of myconids-fungus people who normally live deep underground. Though they can't abide sunlight, these myconids used to welcome visitors now and then. In particular, they traded with Tarak from Dragon's Rest, giving him rare fungi  that grow in their caves in exchange for food scraps and other waste from the cloister, which nourished the fungi in the caves. Recently,  though, the myconids have rejected Tarak's visits and placed a monstrous guardian at the entrance to their caves that keeps all visitors away. The  reason for this sudden shift in  the  myconids' behavior is that a blight has spread through the CHA P T E R  2  I  S EAGROW C AV E Scaves and is poisoning the myconids, twisting their gardens, and even laying low their leader, Sinensa. The source of the blight is the tomb of the red dragon Sharruth deep beneath the island. Noxious fumes from the dragon's tomb normally filter up through the rock and vent to the surface through a cavern at the back of Seagrow Caves that the myco­nids avoid, but the vent has become blocked, and the fumes have spilled into the myconids' caves. Besides this insidious poison, visitors to Seagrow Caves must face one additional  threat: the stirges that nest in the caves. These blood-sucking mon­sters aren't much of a threat individually and don't bother the bloodless myconids, but they can be deadly in large numbers. SE AGROW  C AV E S   FEATUR E S  The caves have the following features: Ceilings. Unless noted otherwise, the ceilings in the caverns are 20 feet high, and the tunnels connect­ing the caverns are  1 5  feet high. Light. The interior caves are illuminated by biolumi­nescent fungi, which provide dim light throughout the area. See "Vision" in the rulebook. Walls. The cave walls are formed from hexagonal columns of dark gray basalt-volcanic rock origi­nating from Sharruth's undersea tomb. The walls provide hand- and footholds, so climbing the walls doesn't require an ability check. Fumes. Toxic volcanic fumes from deep below the island are slowly poisoning the fungi in the caves. A faint smell of sulfur pervades the place, grow­ing stronger the closer one  gets to area  B6. If the characters take a long rest inside the caves before opening the vent in  B6,  each  character must suc­ceed on a DC 1 3  Constitution saving throw or be­come poisoned (see "Conditions" in the rulebook). The lesser restoration spell ends this effect, as does finishing a long rest in fresh air. RUN N I N G  THI S  C HAPTER Once the characters decide to visit Seagrow Caves, they have two options for reaching the site: By Boat. Dragon's Rest has a rowboat the charac­ters can take around the western end of the is­land. (This is Tarak's preferred method.) The trip to Seagrow Caves is 5 miles, which takes about 3 hours and 20 minutes to row. Along the  Coast. Walking around the coast of the island is a little easier than rowing, even though it's farther because the characters have to walk around the bays instead of rowing across them. The 7-mile trip takes only 2 hours and 20 minutes at a normal walking pace. The characters can choose whether they want to walk on the cliffs high above the sea or pick their way among the tide pools at the base of the cliffs. The lower route is available only at low tide (see the Tides table). APPROACH I N G  AT  S E A  LEVEL If the characters arrive at Seagrow Caves at sea level, read the following text: A  c l i ff  of d a r k  gray  stone towers  two  h u n d red feet a bove  the  cra s h i n g  waves, which  rush  in  and  out  of a yaw n i n g  cave  m o u t h .

Two  n at u r a l   stai rways  fo r m ed  o f  sto n e  col­u m n s  offer ways down the c l i ffs. E NTERING THE  C AV E S  At high tide, the 40-foot-high tunnel (area B l) is flooded all the way to area B2. The natural stair­ways, which are not shown on the map of Seagrow Caves, descend the  cliffs into  the sea. The  charac­ters can either wait for low tide or row or swim into the tunnel. At low tide, a 5-foot-wide pathway is exposed along the base of the cliffs and the edge of the tunnel. The tides shift every 6 hours, as summarized on the Tides table.

They aren't malicious, though, and they don't resort to violence immediately. Adults use their Rapport Spores to telepathically warn visitors to leave. (See "Rapport Spores" below for details about this form of communication.) Sprouts flee toward the nearest adults to warn them of intruders. If the characters attack, the myconids defend themselves. To convince a hostile myconid to converse or to allow the characters to do anything other than leave the caves, a character must succeed on a DC 20 Charisma check. Depending on the character's ap­proach, the Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion skill can apply to the check. Mentioning Tarak's name or presenting the offering he sent the myco­nids grants advantage on this check. An indifferent myconid is willing to explain what is going on in Seagrow Caves.  The sprouts know only that their leader, Sinensa, has fallen ill-and that a nasty smell pervades their caves. Adult my­coriids know that the "crystal cave" (area B6) is the source of the foul odor and that Sinensa fell ill after going into that cave to investigate the issue. The myconids normally avoid that cave because sunlight filters into it by way of the vent at the western end of the cave, and even diffuse sunlight is unpleasant to these cave-dwelling creatures. RAPPORT  SPORES A myconid's Rapport Spores ability allows all in­telligent creatures in the area to communicate tele­pathically with each other. The characters and the myconids are effectively speaking thoughts at each other. This effect doesn't allow any creature to probe CHAPTER 2  I  S EAGROW  C AV E S·�r--f  SEAGROW (AVESMAP  3:  5 E A G R O W   CAVESinvasively into another creature's mind. But it tran­scends language barriers, and you can play around with the kind of communication that the spores al­low. Myconids' facial expressions might be difficult to read, but their telepathic communication might carry a direct expression of the myconids' emotional state. For example, when the myconids talk about their ailing leader, the characters might feel a deep sadness and a sense of anxiety much more clearly and powerfully than mere words and facial expres­sions can communicate. The effect of Rapport Spores lasts for 1  hour, so characters might be telepathically linked to each other whenever they're within 30 feet of each other even after they leave the cave. Encourage the play­ers to think about  how this might affect their charac­ters. Does it make them feel closer to their friends? Does it ease any suspicions they might have had about each other? DISTRES S   SPORES When myconids take damage, they release spores that alert all other myconids within 240 feet of them. All myconids in the cave are in range of each other's Distress Spores. Myconids in areas B2 and B3 move to area B4 if they detect Distress Spores. CHAPTER 2  I  S E AGROW C AV E SSEAGROW C AV E S   L O C ATIONS The following locations are keyed to map 3, which shows the layout of the Seagrow Caves.

At high tide, the tunnel is flooded, so visitors must approach by boat or swim. At low tide, walkways formed by the tops of stone columns line the sides of the tunnel, leading to a flight of natural steps up to area B2. A spore servant octopus lurks in the water and attacks any creatures (other than myco­nids) who enter the tunnel, regardless of the state of the tides. Before the myconid leader lapsed into unconsciousness, it created this guardian to keep outsiders away. As described on the previous page, the water level here varies by up to  10 feet with the tides. At high tide, the water is about 8 feet deep along the edges of the tunnel and 25 feet deep in the middle. At low tide, the walkways along the edges are exposed, and the water is 1 5  feet deep in the middle. 2nd-Level Characters.  If the characters are 2nd level, two stirges clinging to the tunnel ceiling are disturbed if fighting breaks out in this area and join the battle. The stirges ignore the spore servant. \ B 2 :   FU NGUS  FARM Th i s  fifty-foot- h i g h  cavern  is  a  forest of m u ltico l o red fu n g i ,   r a n g i n g  from  tiny fi l a m e nts to tree-sized  m u s h ·  roo m s .

The waterfall is fed from a pool in the upper cave, which in turn is supplied by runoff trickling down from the surface.  Both  pools are 5 feet deep at most. The two mushroom people are myconid sprouts named  Molen and Kraz. They are spreading fer· tilizer from area B3, while two myconid adults named  Hipsiz and Rugoso tend the mushrooms near the upper pool, out of sight from below. All four myconids are oblivious to the true threat in the cave-three violet fungi that grow among the harm· less mushrooms here. If the characters move into the cave toward the myconids, one violet fungus attacks them, extending long tendrils that cause immediate rot when they touch living flesh. Read this text: moves away from an active violet fungus, have an­other fungus stir and attack that character on the fungus's next turn. If a character scans the fungus farm looking for more violet fungi, cast as much doubt as you can: many of the fungi look sickly and purple but pose no danger. Myconids.  The myconid  sprouts avoid the char­acters and the violet  fungi.  If the  adults become aware of danger through the noise of combat (or the sprouts' Distress Spores), they move as quickly as they can to protect the sprouts. If the characters defeat the violet fungi, the my­conids' attitude improves to indifferent, and they are willing to  speak to the characters (using their Rapport Spores). The adults agree to accompany the characters  and vouch for them with the rest of the myconid colony,  improving the other myconids' attitude to indifferent as well. Blighted Fungi. A character who examines any of the fungi notices that many of the mushrooms are sickly, shriveled, and blotched with black patches of decay. The blight has no obvious source. Treasure. The fungus farm contains heart cap mushrooms ready for harvest. A character who spends  1 5  minutes searching this  chamber for use­ful fungi and succeeds on a DC 1 2  Intelligence (Na­ture) or Wisdom (Survival) check finds  ld6 of these reddish mushrooms, which bear an unsettling re­semblance to human hearts. Tarak can make each heart cap mushroom into a potion of healing. 2nd-Level Characters.  If the characters are 2nd level, add two violet fungi to this encounter.

Because the violet fungi move so slowly, it's easy for the characters to stay out of their reach and kill the fungus monsters with ranged attacks. The interesting part of this en­counter is identifying the danger. One violet fungus moves and attacks to start the encounter, but the other two remain motionless until characters move close to them. You don't need to keep track of exactly where ev­eryone is standing in  the room. Instead, rely on your sense of what's fun and exciting. When a character Three myconid sprouts named Bispo, Valup, and Popple work here gathering fertilizer for use in area B2. The bulbous object is a stirge nest, which characters can identify with a successful DC 1 5  In­telligence (Nature) check. If a character moves more than 5 feet into the chamber, six stirges emerge from the nest and attack. Meanwhile, the sprouts flee toward area B4 at the first sign of intruders, re­lying on the distraction of the stirges to escape. 2nd-Level Characters.

The two conscious myconids move quickly to confront any intruders who aren't escorted by other myco­nids, and they respond with violence to any threat.

The treatment is keeping the leader alive for now, but it is a losing battle. Sinensa's only hope is for the blight to end. The adults zealously defend their leader, immediately attacking intruders who aren't accompanied by other myconids. Treasure.

Streaks of soot trace a  path  along t h e  cave wa l l s  between the p u rp l e  cryst a l s  and t h e  fi s s u re. Two fume drakes lurk amid the sulfurous fumes. These elemental creatures look like little dragons formed entirely of greenish smoke. They don't leave this cave, but they rush to attack any creature that enters it. This cave is the source of the blight spreading through the myconid colony. As the characters explore the cave, they can easily determine that noxious fumes from deep beneath the island seep up around the vein of purple crystals. Ordinarily, the fumes vent to the surface through a fissure in the west wall, but the fissure is now blocked by the enormous orange crystal, which is also the source of the light here. The heart of the problem is the tomb of the red dragon Sharruth, deep beneath the island. The pres­ence of such a powerful dragon far underground causes the volcanic activity that produces the nox­ious fumes. What's  more,  the  dragon's  energy occa­sionally tears open small rifts in the fabric of reality that lead to the Elemental Plane of Fire-another di­mension of reality that is the cosmic source of fiery energy. The Plane of Fire is the origin of both the orange crystal blocking the vent (which is actually an egg case) and the creatures currently in the cave. Fire Crystal.  Destroying the orange crystal block­ing the western fissure allows the noxious fumes to escape the cave and stops the blight that is harming the myconids. A single strong whack with a weapon, a crowbar, or another tool is sufficient to shatter it. When the crystal breaks,  a two-foot-diameter sphere of smoldering obsidian falls to the floor amid the other pieces and breaks open, releasing a fire snake from this stony egg. Seeing the characters only as fuel, it attacks them at once. Breaking the fire crystal also reveals the reason the myconids avoid this cave: the cave is imme­diately filled with shimmering sunlight refractea through the crystals that line the vent.  Bright light fills the entire area. Treasure.  The fire  snake's  egg breaks into 25  tiny GAI N  A  LEVEL After they complete this chapter of the adventure, the characters gain a level.

E N DI N G  TH I S  C HAPTER If the characters destroy the orange crystal s o  the toxic fumes can escape the caves, the myconids' attitude improves to friendly. Sinensa, the myconid leader, regains consciousness the following morn­ing. If the characters are present when Sinensa awakens, Sinensa gives them the ruby morel from area  BS  and permission to  keep  any other treasure or mushrooms they collected in the caves. Once the characters return to Dragon's Rest, Tarak can use the ruby morel to make an elixir of health  (described in appendix A), which he gives to the  characters in  gratitude for their efforts.

S H I PWRE C K  OVERVIEW Ever since the violent  death of a gold dragon on the rocky shoal on the north side of Stormwreck Isle, the bone-strewn rocks have been the site of many shipwrecks through the centuries. One such ship­wreck left a lasting mark on the island. About forty years ago, a ship named Compass Rose carrying passengers bound for the cloister wrecked on the shoal, killing all aboard. To the hor­ror of the cloister's residents, those who drowned found their way ashore as shambling zombies. Since the loss of that ship, each new shipwreck has brought a fresh wave of zombie sailors to the island's shore. Fortunately, wrecks are rare-or they were,  until recently. Not long ago, a harpy settled into the wreck of Compass Rose. With its magically entrancing voice, C HA P T E R   3  I  C U R S E D   S H I PW R E C K  the harpy has been luring ships to crash on the shoal and feasting on the unlucky sailors.

This curse is re­sponsible for the drowned sailors animating as zom­bies. Most of the sailors who were aboard the ship when it wrecked are long gone, but some zombies have been trapped in the wreck for years. S H I PWRE C K  FEATU RES The wreck of Compass Rose is located at the north­ern end of a long spur of sharp rocks and dragon bones jutting from the ocean waves, about 21/2 miles from the cloister. It remains mostly above the water, held up by the ancient bones that tore its hull. The wreck has the following features: Walls. The soggy wooden walls are aged to a sickly black and green. Algae and barnacles grow on walls throughout the wreck. Ceilings. The ceilings in the ship are 8 feet high. Doors. The doorways are 6 feet high, and the doors are in the same waterlogged condition as the walls. Light. During the day, the sun fills the upper deck and main deck with bright light and the lower deck with  dim light. Sunlight doesn't reach into the hold, and the whole wreck is dark at night.  See "Vision" in the rulebook. RUN NI N G  TH I S  C HAPTER Dragon's Rest has a rowboat the characters can take to visit the wreck of Compass Rose. The trip of 21/2 miles takes about 1  hour and 40 minutes to row.

If the characters pull the rowboat up to the south (starboard) side of the ship, they can easily tie up the little boat to the derelict's rigging and climb onto the main deck (area C l). However, they're free to ex­plore other possibilities for getting aboard, such as swimming through the hole in the hold (area C9).

A rope ladder runs up the mast to the crow's nest, secure despite the condition of the wreck. The mast sways alarmingly as characters climb, and at the top of the 50-foot climb the charac­ters find that they are leaning out over the water on the port (north) side of the ship. The crow's nest now serves as a nest for the harpy that has made Compass Rose its lair. The bas­ket-shaped area is stuffed with wood shavings, dry grass, and shredded canvas from ships' sails. Bits of bones, tufts of hair, and shiny baubles are also visi­ble in the harpy's nest. Harpy's Return. When the characters arrive at the shipwreck, the harpy is out looking for another ship to lure onto the rocks. It returns after the char­acters have spent some time  aboard,  as described in "Harpy's Return" later in this chapter. Treasure.  Characters who search  through the crow's nest find a small gold bracelet worth 25 gp, a single  gold hoop earring worth 25  gp, two small ti­ger eye gems worth  10 gp each, and one bloodstone gem worth 50 gp.

Written across the bottom of the por­trait are the words "Aleitha and Brastos-together forever." The black-haired woman wears a sailor's uniform similar to the tatters worn by the zombies aboard this ship. The blond-haired man wears a merchant's fine clothes. Floorboard Stash.  A character who searches the cabin and succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Percep­tion) check notices a floorboard in the middle of the room that is raised slightly above its neighbors. A character who lifts the floorboard triggers a trap: a tiny dart shoots up, making an attack against the character. Its attack bonus is +5. If it hits, it deals 2 (ld4) piercing damage, and the character must suc­ceed on a DC 1 1  Constitution saving throw or take 3 (ld6) poison damage.  Once the trap is triggered, it does not trigger again unless a character resets it. (If the characters figure out a way to lift the floor­board from a safe distance, the dart misses.) Treasure. A sack full of 200 gp rests in a small compartment beneath the raised floorboard.

The wheel bears the name of the ship-Compass Rose-engraved and inlaid with mother-of-pearl, though in the wheel's current position the name is upside down. If a character turns the wheel, it snaps free of its axle and falls. If the character tries to catch the wheel before it hits the deck, ask the player to make a DC  10 Dexterity saving throw.  On a successful save, the character catches the wheel. On a failed save, the wheel hits the deck with a loud thud that catches the attention of the zombies in area C4. A moment later, the thud is answered by a loud crash against the door to C4, which repeats every 10 to  1 5  seconds. C4 :  CAPTA I N 'S  QUARTERS The door to the captain's quarters is barricaded from the inside, though the heavy wooden bar block­ing the  door is half rotten. A character who tries to force the door open can  break it down with a suc­cessful DC  10  Strength check. The  door crashes  open to  reveal  two  d rowned  sai l o rs in  a  c a b i n  that m u s t  o n ce  have  been  l u x u ri o u s .

If the characters dropped the wheel in area C3 or needed more than one Strength check to open the door into this room, the two zombies  are beside the door when it opens. Otherwise, they're aimlessly shuffling around the cabin. In either case, they move to attack the characters right away. Hole  to  the Hold.  The hole  beside the  captain's bed formed when the rotting floorboards collapsed under the weight of the captain's sea chest. It broke through the floor of the lower deck (area C8) as well, coming to rest in the hold (area C9). Treasure.  Two  small drawers in the desk hold a pouch containing 50 gp, a set of cartographer's tools, and a dagger. The compass set in the desktop can easily be pried free; it is worth 25 gp. 2nd-Level Characters.  If the characters are 2nd level, add a third zombie to this encounter.

The zombie is an obvious threat, but another Un­dead  monster-a ghoul-lurks in the aft part of the hold. Much more cunning than the zombies, the ghoul waits to attack until the characters are busy with the zombie. It hopes to paralyze a character with its Claw attack, then drag the paralyzed charac­ter away to feast on while the other characters con­tend with the zombie. Unlike the zombies, the ghoul is not a former member of the ship's crew, but a vile scavenger drawn by the presence of decaying flesh. The water on the floor ranges from about 6 inches deep on the starboard (south) side of the ship to 1 8  inches deep on the port (north) side. The water makes the entire lower deck difficult terrain (see "Difficult Terrain" in the rulebook). . ..  ..,:. Hole  to  the Hold.  A hole in  the  ceiling in  the northwest part of the area leads up to the captain's quarters (area C4). It's matched by a similar hole directly below it. The holes were caused by the cap­tain's chest falling through the floorboards all the way to the hold, where it came to rest (see area C9). 2nd-Level Characters.  If the characters are 2nd level, add two zombies to this encounter. Treasure.  Some of the goods in the crates here remain valuable_ Using a crowbar, a character can pry open a crate in 1  minute; without a crowbar, it takes  1 0  minutes. When a character opens a crate, roll a d6 and consult the Crate Contents table to de­termine what's inside. The characters can find each item on the table once.

See "Climbing, Swimming, and Crawling" and "Suffocating" in the "The Environment" section of the rulebook as the characters venture into the submerged hold. Fortunately for them, unless some­thing goes wrong, there's no significant time pres­sure on the characters as they swim around here. They can surface (at the hole in area C8's floor, or at the top of the stairs up to C8) to breathe as often as they need to. Captain's Chest. A heavy iron chest lies on the floor of the hold, directly beneath the hole it fell through. If a character  opens the  chest here,  a large air bubble rushes out, and a packet, wrapped and sealed in waxed fabric, rises up after it. Though the chest is heavy (about 1 25 pounds), the characters can also carry it to the surface before opening it. The chest contains a pouch holding 55 gp and three turquoise stones (worth  10 gp each), as well as a pair of b oots  of elvenkind. The floating packet contains the captain's journal, which has been keep safe from the water by its wrapping.  A braid of hair is stuck in the pages like a bookmark, indicating the log's last entry. The last entry reads as follows: C H A P T E R  3  I  C U R S E D   S H I P W R E C K  1 9  Tarsakh O u r  j o u rn ey  i s  e n d e d ,  t h o u gh  I  fea r  m y  own  i s  to conti n u e  in  the  most  horri b l e  way  i m a g i n a b l e.

The talisman is formed from long locks of hair­some blonde, some black-braided together and knotted around two small finger bones. If a charac­ter casts detect magic, the talisman is revealed to carry magic of the school of necromancy. See "End­ing This Chapter" for more about the talisman. Tarsakh is a month in the calendar of the Forgot­ten Realms, roughly corresponding to April. No year is specified in the log. About Orcus. Known as the Demon Prince of Un­death and the Blood Lord, the demon lord Orcus is a fiend whose power rivals that of the gods. Ruling over hordes of demons in the nightmarish plane of existence called the Abyss, Orcus yearns to trans­form the multiverse into a ghastly place of death. Many Undead creatures (like ghouls) worship him or seek to bargain with him in exchange for some fragment of his power over undeath. A New  Threat. After the characters find the cap­tain's chest, when they come up from the hold to the lower deck, they hear a heavy thump on the deck above them as the harpy lands on the main deck. See "Harpy's Return" below. HARPY'S  RETURN The harpy that makes its lair in the crow's nest (area C l) returns to the ship when one of these con­ditions is met: •  The characters find the captain's chest in the hold (area C9) and return to the lower deck (area CS). •  The characters finish a short or long rest on the ship. The next time the characters show themselves on the main deck, the harpy confronts them: A terrify i n g  m o n ste r  perches  on  the  top of the  crow's nest, s p read i n g  its  scraggly w i n gs  a n d  screec h i n g  h a rs h ly.  I t s  w i n g s  a n d   legs  rese m b l e  t h o s e  o f  a  m a ngy vu ltu re ,  w h i l e  its  head,  torso,  and  arms  look  a l most h u m a n .   I t  c l utches  a  l a rge  bone l i ke  a  c l u b  and  flexes its t a l o n s .  On its first turn, the harpy uses its Luring Song in an attempt to charm the characters and draw them up to the crow's nest. A character charmed by the harpy's Luring Song thinks it's the most beautiful sound they have ever heard. It's easy to imagine how a ship might be lured off course to get closer to the source of this music. TALKIN G  TO  THE  HARPY The harpy is cruel and hungry for flesh, but it speaks Common and can be reasoned with. It's not easy to convince the bloodthirsty monster to change its ways and leave the wreck of Compass Rose, but if the players come up with a strong argument (pos­sibly supported with high rolls on Charisma checks), the harpy cooperates. These tactics are the most likely to convince the harpy to leave: •  If the characters have already reduced the harpy to fewer than half its hit points, it might flee. •  If the characters claimed the treasure from the crow's nest while the harpy was absent, it might agree to leave in exchange for the return of its treasure. •  If the characters are 2nd level and two harpies are present (see below), characters can play on the distrust between the two harpies and might con­vince them to part ways and leave the area. 2 N D -LEVEL  CHARACTERS If the characters are  2nd level, add a second harpy to the encounter. This harpy initially perches on the ballista in area C2 and uses its own Luring Song. Although they're allies, the harpies don't trust each other. E N D I NG TH I S   C HAPTER I f  the characters defeat the harpy, one problem is solved: no more ships will be lured to the rocks, and shipwrecks will once again be a rarity. If the  characters find Aleitha's talisman in the hold, they can solve the zombie problem entirely. If they bring the talisman to Runara and explain what they found in the captain's log,  Runara  nods sadly. She  remembers Aleitha's husband, Brastos, but he  died many years ago. He was laid to rest in the graveyard atop the cliffs at the northern point of the island, northwest of Dragon's Rest. The graves in the little clifftop cemetery are cov­ered in white wildflowers and  marked with simple wooden slabs. If the characters lay the talisman on Brastos's grave, bury it in the soil over the grave, or burn it atop the grave, the wind  seems to sigh in relief. Thick fog forms around the rocks north of the island. The fog lingers overnight, and when it dis­perses, no trace of Compass Rose remains. The characters might also disregard the words of the captain's journal and destroy the talisman while aboard the ship. This also breaks the curse-the characters still feel something like a sigh in the air, fog rises up to engulf the wreck while the characters are rowing away, and the ship is gone when the fog lifts  the next day. If the characters undo the talisman's curse, the next time they sleep, the cleric character has an­other dream. Read this text to the cleric's player: I n  your d rea m ,  you  are  once  a g a i n   on  the d eck of t h e  s h i p  t h at  brought y o u  h e re, a n d  y o u  see Stormwreck I s l e  s h rouded  i n  d a rkness,  just  as  it was  i n  your e a r l i e r  d re a m s .

GAI N  A  LEVEL After they complete this chapter of the adventure, the characters gain a level. If they visited Compass Rose  before Seagrow Caves, they advance to 2nd level. The residents of Dragon's Rest urge them to visit Seagrow Caves next (see  "Sea Caves" on page 1 2). If the characters have already explored the caves, they advance to 3rd level and are ready to visit  Clifftop Observatory in chapter 4. See "Lost Wyrmling" on page 1 3 .  The character sheets explain what happens when characters gain a level. C H APTER 3  I  C U R S E D  S H I PW R E C K  CHAP T E R   4 C LIFFTOP  O BSERVATORY Turs CHAPTER ASSUMES THE  CHARACTERS VISIT the observatory after exploring Seagrow Caves and the wreck of Compass Rose, and thus have reached 3rd level. If they come here before visiting the other adventure sites, the combat encounters are probably too difficult for them. That's the reason Runara won't give the characters the moonstone key or information about the observatory until after they've  dealt with the island's other problems. If necessary, you can have  Runara warn the charac­ters that they're not ready to face this part of the adventure yet. O B S E RVATORY  OVE RVIEW During its heyday, the Clifftop Observatory was a marvel of magical innovation. Adorned with gor­geous stained glass windows  and  marble spires, the observatory's towers stood high above the churn­ing sea on separate islets, linked by shimmering bridges of magical energy. But the observatory was wrecked when Runara battled her blue dragon rival centuries ago, and now it lies in ruin, a crumbled memory overtaken by nature. In recent months, the observatory ruins have become the home of an arrogant blue dragon wyrm­ling called Sparkrender, a descendant of Runara's ancient rival. Like his ancestor,  Sparkrender seeks to claim the destructive magic that lingers at the site. Like Runara, Sparkrender has recruited ko­bolds to join his cause. About five days before the characters arrived on the island, a bronze dragon wyrmling named Aidron left the safety of Dragon's Rest and Runara's tute­lage and came to the ancient observatory. The two wyrmlings met and immediately clashed. Sparkren­der attempted to turn the bronze wyrmling against Runara, but Aidron's hatred of chromatic dragons was stronger than his disagreement with Runara. Ultimately, Sparkrender overpowered Aidron and imprisoned him in the observatory ruins,. Sparkrender believes Aidron is the key to un­locking the observatory's magic and claiming his ancestor's power. With the bronze wyrmling imprisoned, Sparkrender began planning a ritual that will awaken the spirits of all the island's dead dragons and bind them to his will-at the cost of Aidron's life. O B SE RVATORY  FEATU R E S  The observatory i s  built o n  a series o f  basalt spires jutting up from the ocean at the southeastern tip of Stormwreck Isle. Almost all the structure's former ceilings and walls have crumbled away, exposing the ruins to the open air. Unless otherwise noted, the ruins stand 30 feet above the ocean's surface. The rugged cliffs offer abundant hand- and footholds, so a character who jumps or falls into the water and survives (see "Fall­ing" in the rulebook) can climb back up without needing to make an ability check. RUN NI N G  THI S  C HAPTER Once the characters decide t o  visit the Clifftop Observatory, they have three  options for reach­ing the site: By Boat. Dragon's Rest has a rowboat the charac­ters can take around the eastern end of the island. The trip to the observatory is 5 miles, which takes about 3 hours and 20 minutes to row. Along  the Coast. Walking around the  coast of the island is a little easier than rowing, and a quicker trip despite the characters  having to walk around the eastern bay instead of rowing across it. The 6-mile trip takes only 2 hours at a normal walking pace. Overland. The characters can walk southeast from Dragon's Rest to the  head of the bay, where a rough path cuts across the island to the eastern bay. The rocky ground of the island is difficult terrain, but this is still the fastest and most direct route. Characters can make the 3V2-mile trip in about 1  hour and  15 minutes. APPROAC H I NG  BY  LAND If the characters approach the observatory by land, read the following text: C l a m be r i n g  over the  rocky g ro u n d  of Stormwreck I s l e ,  you  s pot strange, twisted  protru s i o n s  of g l assy crystal j utti n g  from  the earth. The vegetation  i n  t h i s  a r e a  bears  red d i s h  branch i n g  s c a r s  t h at f o r m  s i m i l a r  s h a pes.  S u d d e n ly, y o u  h e a r  a  screec h i n g  roa r  a n d  notice a  w i n ged ,  gl itte r i n g  b l u e  s h a p e  swoo p i n g  ove rhead . The blue shape is Sparkrender flying by. This glimpse of the dragon is an opportunity to make your players nervous about the foe they're about to face. Feel free to elaborate on the description of Sparkrender and play on the characters' worry that he might spot them, but ultimately he passes by without noticing them. The characters see him come to rest on a rocky spire off the coast as he re­turns to his hoard among the ruins (area D5). A character who examines the crystalline pro­trusions or the scarred vegetation can make a DC 10 Intelligence (Nature) check. On a success, the character recognizes the phenomenon as a sign of lightning strikes-or the lightning breath of a blue or bronze dragon. Assuming the characters continue toward the observatory, they soon arrive at area Dl, de­scribed below. APPROACH I N G  BY WATE R  I f  the characters row to the observatory, read this text instead: As you  round  the  south eastern t i p  of the  i s l a n d ,  you can  see c r u m b l i n g  r u i n s  atop  basalt co l u m n s  j u st off the  m a i n   i s l a n d   body.  If you  p u l l  the  boat a s h o re  o n  t h e  i s l a n d ,  it w o u l d  be a n   easy wa l k  u p  t o  t h e  t o p  of the  cl iffs, t h o u gh  there  is  no obvious  b r i d ge  from  t h e  cl iffs  to the  r u i n s .  Alte rnatively, yo u  could tie t h e  boat up  at the bottom  of the co l u m n s  and  try to  c l i m b  d i ­rectly  u p  t o  t h e  r u i n s .  As y o u  consider t h e s e  opt i o n s ,  y o u  h e a r  a  screech­ing  roa r  and  notice a  winged, g l itte r i n g  b l u e  s h a p e  swoo p i n g t h ro u gh  the a i r  ahead o f  yo u .  The fi g u r e  c o m e s  to  rest a t o p  the co l u m n  fa rthest from  Sto rm­wreck  Isle  a n d  vanishes from  s i g ht .  Again, Sparkrender does not notice the characters as he returns to his lair, but feel free to tease the players with the idea that he might notice them. If the characters beach the boat on the shore, they can easily climb the bluffs to area Dl, described below. If they tie up the boat at the base of one of the pillars, they can instead climb to the area atop it (area D2, D3, D4, or D5). SPARKRENDER'S  KOB O L D  ALL I E S  The kobolds who joined forces with Sparkrender are lawful evil and cruel. Their initial reaction to­ward outsiders is hostile (see "Social Interaction" in the rulebook), but they're more likely to warn intrud­ers to leave the ruins than to immediately attack. They readily threaten violence and back up their threats with combat if necessary. As an action, a character can try to convince a hostile kobold to have a conversation or to allow the characters to explore the area,  doing so on a suc­cessful DC 1 5  Charisma check.  Depending on the character's approach, the Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion skill can apply to the check.

The wyrmling is waiting for the sculpture in the rotunda ruins (area D2) to tell him it's time to act The kobolds think it must be soon-possibly even today. Dragon Visitor. Not long ago, another dragon ar­rived. This other dragon was about Sparkrender's size but looked like greenish-yellow metal. They remember hearing the two arguing at the obser­vatory tower (area DS), and they have heard the other dragon roaring and crashing around inside the tower (area D6) since then. Caved-In Wall. Though the kobolds have been try-.  ing to tidy the ruins, Sparkrender specifically told them not to clean up the newly caved-in wall at the base of the observatory tower (area D6).  The caved-in wall is visible from area D3. The following locations are keyed to map 5, which shows the layout of the Clifftop Observatory.

At the base of each statue is a small hexagonal indentation, about 1  inch wide and 2 inches deep­perfectly sized to accommodate the moonstone key Runara gave them. When the key is inserted into the base of either statue, magical light sparks to life in both statues' open mouths, and a shimmering bridge made of iridescent magical energy extends from the over­look to the observatory ruins (area D2). The bridge is sturdy and lasts until the key is removed from the statue.

The  kobolds  a re  fi gh t i n g  fi e rcely,  but t h e y  seem  cl ose to  b e i n g  overwh e l m e d .  The two winged kobolds are locked in battle with eight stirges. When the characters enter the area, six of the stirges turn their attention to this new, juicier prey. The kobolds try to deal with the remain­ing two stirges, and then decide what to do based on what the characters are doing. If the characters actively help the kobolds during the battle, then the kobolds return the favor. If the characters attack the kobolds instead of (or as well as) the stirges, the ko­bolds fight back. Otherwise, the kobolds hang back, trying to stay out of the way until the fight is over. Once the stirges have been defeated, if the  ko­bolds survive, they approach the characters. Their names are Mek and Minn, and they're the brothers of Myla, the kobold tinkerer at Dragon's Rest. They left their sister for dead after the stirge attack that maimed her wings. They have sworn loyalty to Sparkrender, and they share the dragon's cruel, haughty demeanor. If the characters actively helped the kobolds or mention that Myla is alive, the kobolds' attitude becomes friendly. They offer to introduce the char­acters to their leader and help the characters in any way they can (such as retrieving the moonstone key from area Dl so the characters can activate the bridge to D4). They won't help the characters fight Sparkrender, though; they are loyal to the dragon. Golden Sculpture.  The sculpture in the center of the rotunda is an astronomical model  used for re­search in centuries past. The sculpture depicts the planet of Tori! (the world of the Forgotten Realms), its moon (called Seh1ne), the sun, and seven other planets, as well as one comet with a very eccentric orbit. A character who studies the sculpture can puzzle out its importance with a successful DC 1 5  Intelligence (Arcana) check: its current position sug­gests the comet will soon pass very close to Toril. Sparkrender plans to hold his ritual when the comet is at its closest point. He believes the comet, called the King-Killer Star, controls the destiny of dragons and will  allow him to claim the power of the dragons who fell on Stormwreck Isle. Dragon Elligies.  The stirge attack interrupted the kobolds from their assigned task of preparing this site for Sparkrender's ritual. With the wyrmling's help, they have crudely sculpted five chunks of rub­ble into vaguely draconic shapes and splashed each one with paint, and the kobolds were in the process of arranging them around the metal sculpture. Each effigy has the name of the dragon it represents etched into it. These are the names and colors of the five dragons: Name Color Astalagan Bronze Clyssavar E l d e n e m i r  S h a rruth Tu radaer G o l d  B l u e  Red B rass If the characters ask the kobolds about these dragon effigies, Mek and Minn swell with pride and explain that they crafted them according to Sparkrender's instructions. The kobolds know the effigies have some part to play in Sparkrender's plans. Energy Bridge Anchors.  A pair of dragon statues like the ones in area Dl  stands on the west side of the rotunda, and another pair  stands on the south­west side. If the moonstone key is inserted in one of these statues, the western pair creates a bridge back to the overlook (area Dl), and the southwestern pair creates a bridge to a crumbled and isolated tower (area D4).

Three kobolds (Ekrash, Erp, and Hev) and two winged kobolds (Nuhro and Snirke) currently in­habit this camp, polishing sling bullets and keeping busy until it's time for Sparkrender's ritual. Initially, the kobolds are hostile toward the characters, deter­mined to scare off the intruders. They are suscepti­ble to intimidation, though; as an action, a character can make a DC 1 3  Charisma (Intimidation) check, convincing them to back down on a success.

Though most of the books have fallen apart, one tome-a small black journal with an ornate lock-remains intact. A character who examines the book and succeeds on a DC 1 5  Wisdom (Perception) check notices a small arcane rune engraved above the keyhole on the journal's lock. A character who casts the detect magic spell also sees a faint aura around the keyhole. This rune is a magical trap that triggers if the journal is opened without the use of its original key, which is long lost. A character who makes a suc­cessful DC  1 1  Intelligence (Arcana) check can deter­mine how to disarm the trap: by carefully scratching over the rune with a dagger, a sharp piece of wire, or a similar implement. Once this is done, the jour­nal can safely be opened either by picking the lock with thieves' tools and making a successful DC 1 0  Dexterity check, o r  by breaking the lock with a suc­cessful  DC  1 2  Strength check.

Inside, the journal contains star maps and notes on experiments with magic. One passage is under­lined near the start of the journal. It reads, in an ar­chaic dialect of Common, "To ye four scholars: point your eyes toward the Dragon's light, for it guides your descent into knowledge." This passage is a clue to unlocking the hidden entrance in the observatory tower (area D5). Treasure. A character who searches the tower and succeeds on a DC 1 2  Intelligence (Investigation) check finds a loose brick in the northwest wall. Pull­ing the brick out reveals a hidden compartment con­taining a potion of resistance (lightning; described in appendix A) and a pouch holding  10 gp. D5:  OBSERVATORY TOWER Standing taller than the rest of the observatory, the main floor of this tower is 45 feet above the ocean's surface, which puts it 1 5  feet above the floor of the rotunda (area D2). The kobolds have constructed a rough pulley lift so the wingless kobolds can reach this area when Sparkrender summons them.

Sparkrender the blue dragon wyrmling is currently sleeping here, curled up against the northeast wall. This presents the characters with an important choice: they can waken the dragon and fight him now, or they can sneak past the dragon, find a way into the  secret library below (area D6) and free Aidron, and then fight Sparkrender with Aidron's help. Either approach is fine. The fight will be easier for the characters with Aidron on their side, but they can still triumph without Aidron's help. You don't need to encourage one course of action or the other. Make sure the players realize they have a choice, though. You  can  use  Mek and Minn (the kobolds from D2) to remind the characters there's another dragon around. As you describe the obser­vatory tower, you can also highlight the caved-in wall beneath it (leading to area D6) as a potential point of access to the tower. Or you can just tell the players they have these two options-plus any oth­ers they come up with on their own! Sneaking Around.  If the characters move quietly around the area, they can avoid waking Sparkren­der as long as at least half of them succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity (Stealth) check. If the characters try to turn the statues (see "Hid­den Entrance" below) without waking Sparkrender, have the characters turning the north and east stat­ues (nearest the sleeping dragon) each make a DC 14 Dexterity (Stealth) check. On a failed check, the noise of a turning statue wakes the dragon. Waking the Dragon. If awakened, Sparkrender is hostile toward the characters, growling and barking threats in Draconic. Characters who speak Dra­conic (the paladin and the wizard) can try to con­vince the dragon not to attack by making a DC 1 2  Charisma check and applying the Deception, Intim­idation, or Persuasion skill as appropriate. A char­acter who succeeds on the check stops Sparkrender from attacking immediately, and he instead takes the opportunity to boast about his grand ambitions. If no character successfully intervenes, or if a char­acter mentions Aidron or Runara, Sparkrender snarls and attacks. Despite his youth, Sparkrender is a fearsome foe and a loathsome villain. He uses Breath Weapon on his first turn and  every round it is available thereaf­ter. (Clever characters can try to use the  statues for cover from  the  dragon's breath; see "Cover" in the rulebook.) Consider having the wyrmling deliver short lines of dialogue on each of his turns, inspired by the following examples: •  "You pests will not stand in my way! I will claim the might of my ancestors!" •  "Get out of here before I tire of this game and end you all!" •  "Chromatic dragons are the rightful rulers of this world. Bow down to the children of Tiamat!" •  "Enough of this! This work is too important to be hindered by the likes of you! "  The dragon fights until reduced t o  10 o r  fewer hit points, at which point he swears vengeance against the characters and attempts to flee the island start­ing on his next turn. (He might say something like this as he takes the Disengage action and flies away: "I  swear by Eldenemir the Raging Storm  and the five heads of Tiamat, you will pay for this insult!") If the characters flee, Sparkrender does not pur­sue them, but he taunts them as they run away. (He might say something like, "Yes! Flee before my might, as  all will flee when I claim my inheritance!") If the characters defeat Sparkrender, they hear growling and yelping coming from below them (area D6). Hidden Entrance.  Each of the four statues can be rotated on its base. To unlock the hidden entrance to the observatory's secret archive, each statue must be rotated so it points at the constellation called the Dragon of Dawn on the floor's star map. If the characters found the clue in the isolated study (area D4) exhorting "four scholars" to "point your eyes toward the Dragon's light," they might search the star map for a constellation that looks like a dragon. A character who searches the floor and succeeds on a DC  10 Intelligence (Investigation) check finds a constellation resembling a dragon in the southeast quadrant of the floor. In lieu of that information, a character who searches the room for clues and succeeds on a DC  1 5  Wisdom (Perception) check notices worn grooves in the base of each statue, suggesting the statues can turn on their bases. While turning a statue, a character can make a DC  10 Wisdom (Per­ception) check; if the check succeeds, the character notices the statue settles slightly when it is pointing toward the southeast quadrant of the room and re­quires extra effort to nudge out of that position. Once each statue is in its correct position, a semi­circular section at the center of the floor begins to glow before descending into the library (area D6). It forms a spiral staircase leading down to the floor of the library. When any statue is rotated out of its position, the staircase rises back up, sealing the li­brary shut once more. (A character on the staircase when this happens is lifted up to this area on the rising stairs.) Treasure. With Sparkrender no longer defending his fledgling hoard, characters can gather it up. It includes large piles of coins: 4,500 cp, 2,200 sp, and  1 30 gp. There are also ten gems: five pale blue quartz  crystals worth  10 gp each and five blue jas­per stones worth 50 gp each. A waterproof leather case holds a blue silk fan painted with powdered blue gems, worth 25 gp. There are also a few ordi­nary items Sparkrender enjoyed, including a crude flute with a pleasing sound, an hourglass filled with sparkling sand, and a set of seven candlesticks. D 6 :   SECRET  LIBRARY This space was formerly a hidden archive  of knowl­edge, accessible only to those who knew the obser­vatory's secrets. However, the walls of the tower are crumbling-a fact that Sparkrender used to trap Aidron here. After weakening the bronze wyrmling, Sparkrender forced him into the library and then caused one of the walls to cave in, sealing the exit. If the characters don't use the hidden entrance in area D5, they can attempt to clear away the rubble from the cave-in to access the secret library. To access the rubble, the characters must climb down from area D5 or swim to the bottom of this spire C H APTER 4  I  C LI FFTOP  O B S E RVATORYSPARKRE N DER'S  RITUAL I f  the characters leave the observatory without de­feating Sparkrender, they might return to find the blue wyrmling's ritual underway.  This is most likely to happen if the characters leave and take a long rest before confronting Sparkrender, or if they flee from combat with Sparkrender and return after they've rested. Another possibility is that the characters drive Sparkrender away from the island without killing him, but leave Aidron imprisoned in area D6. In this case, Runara urges the characters to return to the observatory to find Aidron. When they arrive, Sparkrender has also rested, healed, and returned to finish his work. In either case, the characters arrive just as Sparkrender's ritual is getting underway.  (If they took or destroyed the dragon effigies in area D2, they have been replaced by even cruder versions created in a hurry.) Read the following text: Stre a m s  of col o red  l i ght swirl t h ro u gh  the  a i r  a ro u n d  t h e  golden  statue i n  t h e  r u i ned  rot u n d a .

To  stop the ritual, the characters must face Sparkrender (blue dragon wyrmling), potentially with the help of Aidron (bronze dragon wyrmling), if they can free Aidron from his chains (see "Freeing Aidron" below). Any surviving kobolds and winged kobolds lurk here, but they stay out of combat if possible. See "Waking the Dragon" in area D5 for ideas on how to play Sparkrender in this encounter. He uses Breath Weapon as the characters approach the scene (unleashing lightning into the sky), so he has to wait for this action to recharge before he can use it on the characters this time. He fights to the death-he has too much riding on the success of this ritual to abandon it now. and climb up from the water. Clearing the rubble takes one character 30 minutes, or the characters can work together to clear it faster (for example, it takes two characters  1 5  minutes or five characters 6 minutes). If the characters are trying to clear the rubble quietly, it takes twice as long, and at least half of the characters must succeed on a DC  14 Dex­terity (Stealth) check to avoid waking Sparkrender. Once they've cleared the rubble, the characters can access the library's interior. Stale a i r  h eavy with the s m e l l  of o l d  parchment A oods yo u r  nost r i l s .

Aidron the bronze dragon wyrmling excitedly greets the characters when they enter. He has spent days trying to dig his way out through the caved-in wall, but his efforts from the inside only caused fur­ther collapse. He is eager to escape, but if the char­acters ask, he explains his conflict with Sparkren­der. He expresses regret over his inability to defeat the blue wyrmling and concern for the safety of the island's other inhabitants. And he is terrified of the fate Sparkrender has in store for him-the blue dragon plans to use Aidron's death to claim the power of all the dead dragons on the island,  trans­forming himself into a mighty draconic avatar. If the characters have not yet defeated Sparkren­der, Aidron decides to face the blue dragon himself. He flies to the top of the observatory tower (area D5) to confront Sparkrender once more. However, Aidron is too weak to defeat Sparkrender alone; he needs the characters' help. Once Sparkrender is defeated, the bronze wyrm­ling is excited to return to Dragon's Rest with the characters. Treasure.  This library was once a repository of magical knowledge and items of power, though most of its contents are too weathered to read. How­ever, a character who searches through the room and succeeds on a DC 1 5  Intelligence (Investigation) check finds a +l battleaxe or a spell scroll of holdperson (+1  weapons and spell scrolls are both de­scribed in appendix A). A detect magic spell reveals the location of both of these items without requiring an ability check. Aidron has also cataloged the con­tents of the room and can direct the characters to these valuable items. C H A P T E R  4  I  C L I F FTOP  O B S E RVATORYDragon  Spirits.

A character might break an ' .. , bat (on initiative count 0, after everyone else has acted),  a random magical effect occurs, caused by the magical lights that swirl around the rotunda.

Freeing Aidron.  Aidron is bound by three heavy chains that keep him restrained. He can still take actions, such as biting or clawing an enemy that comes within his reach, but he knows Sparkrender is unaffected by his lightning Breath Weapon, so he doesn't bother using it. He might use his Repulsion Breath if he can see a good use for it. Large clasps attach the chains to iron rings em­bedded in the ground. A character can use an action to undo one clasp. Once all three clasps are undone, Aidron is no longer restrained, though the chains reduce his speed by  10 feet. Removing the chains from Aidron takes  10 minutes. Disrupting the Ritual. The most straightforward way to prevent Sparkrender from completing his rit­ual and obtaining the power he craves is to kill him. But characters can also use their actions in combat to interfere with the process and hinder Sparkren­der in magical ways. Let the players try whatever they can imagine, using these  ideas as examples: Manipulate the Effigies. A character might use an action to lift an effigy closer to the central sculp­ture, breathe a prayer to the dragon it represents, or otherwise coax magic from it. Doing so imme­diately triggers the corresponding effect from the Dragon Spirits Table. effigy or throw it over the crumbling wall and into the ocean below.  This ensures the corresponding effect does not occur again. (Re roll if you get that result on the Dragon  Spirits table.) Manipulate the Sculpture. Characters might try to  manipulate the golden sculpture as a way of disrupting the ritual. The sculpture is large and sturdy, though, so a single action has no notice­able effect on the sculpture or the magic. (The sculpture has AC 20,  27 hit points, and immunity to poison and  psychic damage.) However, disturb­ing the sculpture does distract Sparkrender. The first time a character uses an action to attack or otherwise try to disturb the sculpture, the dis­tracted blue dragon has disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws until the end of his next turn.  Once he sees the character's meddling isn't very effective, he can't be distracted in this way again. E N D I NG THE ADVENTURE With Aidron i n  tow, the characters can return vic­torious to Dragon's Rest. Runara is pleased by the bronze wyrmling's safe return. As a reward, she gives each of the characters a potion of healing and an exquisite pearl worth  100 gp. She welcomes them to stay at Dragon's Rest as long as they wish and furnishes them with whatever supplies they need for their travels when they're ready to leave the island. If Sparkrender is dead, she grieves the death of yet another dragon on Stormwreck Isle, but she doesn't condemn the characters for kilting him. If your players wish to continue playing their char­acters, you can use the contents of this set to create your own adventures. The "Exploring the Island" section of chapter 1  offers additional encounters you can use if the characters haven't already faced them. Perhaps Sparkrender (or a relative of his) pursues the characters in search of revenge, or perhaps something uncovered in the secret library leads the characters to a distant locale in pursuit of more adventure. If you want to advance these characters beyond 3rd level and create adventures for them, you'll need the basic rules online or the advanced rulebooks: the Player's Handbook, Dungeon Master's Guide, and Monster Manual. C H APTER 4  I  C LI FFTOP  O B S E RVATO RY APPE N D I X  A MAGIC  ITEMS EVERY ADVENTURE HOL D S  T H E  PROMISE-BUT not a guarantee-of finding one or more magic items. Dragons of Stormwreck Isle contains an assortment of magic items that hints at the wider variety of magic items waiting to be found in the worlds of D&D. USING A  M AGIC  ITE M  A magic item's description explains how the item works. Handling a magic item is enough to give a character a sense that something is extraordinary about the item. To learn more, a character can con­centrate on the item during a short rest, while being in physical contact with the item. At the end of the rest, the character learns the item's properties. Po­tions are an exception; a little taste is enough to tell the taster what the potion does. ITE M  D E S C RI PTIONS These items are i n  alphabetical order. Under an item's name is a line that tells you the type of the item, its rarity, and whether you must attune to it. BOOTS  OF  ELVEN KIND Wondrous Item,  Uncommon While you wear these boots, your steps make no sound, regardless of the surface you are moving across. You also have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks that rely on moving silently. ELIXIR O F  HEALTH Potion,  Rare When you drink this potion, it cures any disease afflicting you, and it removes the blinded, deafened, paralyzed, and poisoned conditions. The clear red liquid has tiny bubbles of light in it.

The DM choose·s the type or determines it randomly from the op­tions below. dlO  Damage Type dlO  Damage Type Acid Cold Fire Force 6 7 8 9 N ecrotic Poison Psyc h i c  Radiant Light n i n g  10 Thunder 2 3 4 5 SPELL  SCROLL Scroll,  Varies A spell scroll bears the words of a single spell, writ­ten in a mystical cipher. If the spell is on your class's spell list, you can read the scroll and cast its spell without providing any material components. Other­wise, the scroll is unintelligible. Casting the spell by reading the scroll requires the spell's normal cast­ing time. Once the spell is cast, the words on the scroll fade, and it crumbles to dust. If the casting is interrupted, the scroll is not lost. If the spell is on your class's spell list but of a higher level than you can normally cast, you must make an ability check using your spellcasting ability to determine whether you cast it successfully. The DC equals  10 + the spell's level. On a success, you cast the spell; on a failure, the spell disappears from the scroll with no other effect. The level of the spell on the scroll determines the spell's saving throw DC and attack bonus, as well as the scroll's rarity, as shown in the Spell Scroll table.

C REATURE  STAT  BLO C KS A creature's stat block provides the essential in­formation that you, as the DM,  need to run it. The following sections explain the various pieces of in­formation you'll find in a stat block. SIZE A stat block tells you a creature's size: Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, Huge, or Gargantuan. Size is ex­plained in  the rulebook. S QUEEZING  INTO  A  SMALLER  SPACE A creature can squeeze through a space large enough for a creature one size  smaller than itself. When a creature is squeezing through such a space, its speed is halved, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws, and attack rolls against it have advantage. TYPE A creature's type is specified in a stat block, indi­cating the family of creatures that it belongs to. The types in the game are Aberration, Beast, Celestial, Construct, Dragon, Elemental, Fey, Fiend, Giant, Humanoid, Monstrosity,  Ooze, Plant, and Undead. ALIGN M E NT A creature's alignment reflects its disposition. See the rulebook for descriptions of the different alignments. ARMOR  C LA S S  A creature that wears armor or carries a shield has an AC that takes its armor, shield, and Dexterity into account. Otherwise, a creature's AC is based on its Dexterity modifier and any natural armor or super­natural resilience it might possess. If a creature wears armor or carries a shield, the kind of armor it wears or shield it carries is noted in parentheses after its AC value. H I T  POINTS A stat block specifies a creature's hit point maxi­mum. In parentheses, the stat block also indicates the Hit Dice that were rolled to determined those hit points, plus the creature's Constitution modifier multiplied by the number of Hit Dice. SPEED A creature's speed tells you how far it can move on its turn. For more information on speed, see the rulebook. All creatures have a walking speed; those that have no form of ground-based locomotion have a walking speed of 0 feet. Some of the creatures in this  adventure have one or more additional move­ment modes: Burrow. A creature that has a burrowing speed can use all or part of its movement to move through sand, earth, mud, or ice. It can't burrow through solid rock unless it has a special trait that allows it to do so. Fly. A creature that has a flying speed can use all or part of its movement to fly. If the creature is in­capacitated or knocked prone while flying, it falls unless it can hover. Swim. A creature that has a swimming speed doesn't need to spend extra movement to swim. AB I LITY  S C OR ES Every creature has six ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma) and corresponding modifiers. For more information on ability scores, see the rulebook. SAV I N G  TH ROWS The Saving Throws entry is reserved for creatures that are proficient in one or more saving throws. Saving throws in a stat block are shown with the total modifier-the creature's ability modifier plus its proficiency bonus. If a creature's stat block says "Con +4," roll a d20 and  add 4 when the creature makes a saving throw using Constitution. S K I LLS The Skills entry is reserved for creatures that are proficient in one or more skills. Skills in a stat block are shown with the total mod­ifier-the creature's ability modifier plus its profi­ciency bonus. If a creature's stat block says "Stealth +4," roll a d20 and add 4 when the creature makes an ability check using Stealth. VU LN ERABI LITIE S ,   R E S I STAN C E S ,  A N D   I M M U NI T I E S  Some creatures have vulnerability, resistance, or immunity to certain types of damage. Additionally, some creatures are immune to certain conditions. These immunities are also noted here. A P PE N D I X  B  I  CREAT U R E S  S E N S E S  The Senses entry gives a creature's passive Wisdom (Perception) score, as well as any special senses the creature has, such as the following: Blindsight. A creature with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without having to rely on sight, within a specific radius. Darkvision. A creature with darkvision can see in dim light within the radius as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. The crea­ture discerns color in darkness as shades of gray. LANGUAGE S The languages that a creature can speak are listed in alphabetical order. C H ALLENGE A well-rested party of four adventurers should be able to defeat a creature that has a challenge rating equal to the adventurers' level without any charac­ters dying. Creatures weaker than  1 st-level charac­ters have challenge ratings lower than  1 .  TRAITS In a stat block, traits are special features that ap­pear right under the creature's Challenge entry. AC TIONS When a creature takes its action, it can choose from the options in the  "Actions" section of its  stat block and the options in the rulebook. MELEE A N D   RANGED ATTAC KS The most common actions that a creature takes in combat are melee and ranged attacks. See the rule­book for how attacks work. A P P E N D I X  B  I  C R E AT U R E S  Any damage or other effects that occur as a result of an attack hitting a target are  described here. As the  DM, you can  use the average damage or roll the damage; for this reason, both the average damage and the die expression are presented. For example, if a monster deals 4 (ld8) slashing damage with its longsword, that notation means you can have the monster deal 4 damage, or you can roll  ld8 to deter­mine the damage. LIMITED  USAGE Some special abilities-whether they are traits, ac­tions, or reactions-have restrictions on the number of times they can be used: X/Day. The notation "X/Day" means a special abil­ity can be used a certain number of times, and then the creature must finish a long rest to regain expended uses. For example, " 1/Day" means a special ability can be used once, and then the creature must finish a long rest to use it again. Recharge X-Y.  The notation "Recharge X-Y" means a creature can use a special ability once, and then the ability has a random chance of re­charging during each subsequent round of com­bat. At the start of each of the creature's turns, roll a d6. If the roll is one of the numbers in the recharge notation, the creature regains the use of that special ability. The ability also recharges when the creature finishes a short or long rest. For example, "Recharge  5-6" means a creature can use the special ability once.  Then, at the start of the creature's turn each round, it regains the use of the ability if it rolls a 5 or 6 on a d6. C REATURE  D E S C RI PTIONS The creatures that appear i n  the adventure are pre­sented in this section in alphabetical order. D RAG O NS Dragons are winged reptiles o f  ancient lineage and fearsome power. The oldest dragons, over a thou­sand years old, are some of the most powerful crea­tures in the world. Dragons' innate magic fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities. The chromatic and metallic dragon families en­compass most of dragonkind. The chromatic drag­ons-black, blue, green,  red, and white-are largely selfish, evil, and feared. The metallic dragons­brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver-are typically noble, good, and respected by the wise. Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, most dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering  gems, jewels, and magic items. Chromatic and metallic dragons pass through four distinct stages of life,  from wyrmlings to ancient dragons. Even wyrmlings in their first five years of life are fearsome threats, and wise adventurers do not underestimate them or dismiss them as "children." BLUE  DRAGONS Vain and territorial, many blue dragons take plea­sure in lording their power over creatures they see as lesser.

The guild has prospered in recent years, and its in fluence is spreading across the  Sword  Coast. You  followed that expansion, hoping to  find your fortune in the city of Neverwinter. Your background shaped your character in important ways. You learned the use of thieves' tools from scoundrels and gamblers  (shown in  " Proficiencies" on the front of this sheet) and picked up the  Goblin language at the same time. Your skill proficiencies in  Deception and Stealth also reflect your upbringing, talking your way out of trouble and skulking past unfriendly eyes. Fortunes in Neverwinter have been  fair but not the  fast riches you hoped  for. You heard a story from a smuggler about a high-ranking member of the  Gilded  Gallows who turned traitor, killed their part ­ner, and fled with a sovereign's ransom in treasure. Thanks to details you've picked up here and there that corroborate the story, you're cer­tain it's more t!fan  just a rumor. Personal Goal: Find the Lost Fortune. Whoever that  Gilder was who skipped out with the gold, they've  covered their tracks well. The trail went cold in Neverwinter, but recently you've learned of a remote island cloister called  Dragon's  Rest. The cloister holds a temple to the dragon god  Bahamut, who is a patron of heroes and a champion of justice. There is also a community of hermits who live there now, the perfect place to hide  for someone wishing to escape their past. If that treasure's there, you'll  find it.

In the remote cloister of  Dragon's  Rest lives an old sage who is supposed to possess great wisdom-or possibly supernatural insight. The cloister holds a temple to the dragon god  Bahamut, who is a patron of heroes and a champion of justice.
