; Boxed Text Example
[boxed_text]
area_003_puzzle = "A few moments after the lid is removed and the sarcophagus' contents examined, a scraping sound echoes through the crypt. The door closes and seals, and a hissing sound makes you aware that some kind of gas is entering the crypt. It does not smell pleasant."

; Special Handling Notes
; - Point of no return: Once the gas trap is triggered in area_003, party cannot exit until puzzle is solved.
; - Resource checks: Thieves' tools needed to disarm throne trap; spells like detect magic or comprehend languages useful.
; - Random encounters: Possible in city streets en route to crypt (DM's discretion).
; - PC backstory: Integration points with Lord's Alliance, Order of the Gauntlet, or Emerald Enclave affiliations.
