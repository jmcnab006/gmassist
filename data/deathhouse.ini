[ADVENTURE]
title: Death House
setting: Haunted row house in the village of Barovia within Strahd's domain

tone: Dark, eerie, suspenseful
background: Death House is an old row house haunted by the spirits of a cult and a tragic family, repeatedly destroyed and rebuilt by dark forces. The cultists once practiced dark arts and sacrificed visitors; Strahd von Zarovich destroyed them but the house remains a locus of evil.
overview: Players start at 1st level and explore Death House, advancing to 3rd level by uncovering secrets and escaping.
