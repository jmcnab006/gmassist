[AREA:38]
name: Ritual Chamber
desc.short: Sunken, waterlogged chamber with altar and spectral cultists.
desc.long: Smooth stone pillars rise from the water, supporting a high ceiling. Stairs ascend to a central dais, atop which sits a bloodstained altar carved with ghastly figures. Chains dangle from above, and a breach in the west wall leads to a refuse-filled alcove. The room is haunted by the cult’s chanting, which falls silent as you enter. When the dais is approached, dark apparitions appear, demanding a sacrifice: “One must die!” Refusing triggers the wrath of Lorghoth the Decayer, a shambling mound lurking in the refuse.
connects: 36, 37
encounters: 13 apparitions (harmless, ritual trigger), 1 Shambling Mound (Lorghoth the Decayer, see [CREATURE] block)
items: None
triggers: Climbing the dais triggers the apparitions’ demand; sacrificing a creature appeases the cult; refusal awakens Lorghoth.
notes: Turning the wheel in the east wall raises/lowers portcullis (area 37); special ritual logic (see [STATE]).
