AD VENTURE BAC KGROU ND 
According to legend, two families of dragons came 
into being in the very first days of the world's cre­
ation. Bahamut, the noble Platinum Dragon, made 
the metallic dragons-gold, silver, bronze, brass, 
and copper. Cruel, five-headed Tiamat made the 
chromatic dragons-red, blue, green, black and 
white. The metallic and chromatic dragons share a 
mutual animosity that originates in the enmity be­
tween Bahamut and Tiamat. 
The origin of Dragon's Rest is rooted in that ani­
mosity. Ages ago, a fire-breathing red dragon called 
Sharruth rampaged up and down the Sword Coast. 
Three metallic dragons joined forces to battle Shar­
ruth and imprisoned her beneath the ocean floor, 
believing seawater would quench her fire and keep 
her bound forever. But Sharruth's fury, legend says, 
caused the undersea volcanic activity that formed 
Stormwreck Isle. 
In all likelihood, Sharruth is long dead and en­
tombed beneath the island, but chromatic dragons 
whisper that she still lives and will one day emerge 
from her prison. One fact is undeniable: the pow­
erful magic embodied in such an ancient dragon 
has left a permanent mark on Stormwreck Isle. 
That magic has drawn other dragons to the island 
throughout the centuries, making it a recurring 
battlefield in the conflict between chromatic and 
metallic dragons. Several of these dragons have 
died there, each leaving behind a spiritual scar that 
causes unpredictable magical effects. 
A hundred years ago, a blue dragon tried to har­
ness this destructi ve magic. A bronze dragon named 
Runara pleaded with him to abandon his schemes. 
When he refused, Runara killed him, adding one 
more dragon grave to the island. 
Runara has grown weary of strife, and Storm­
wreck Isle's wounds are a constant reminder to 
her of the cost of such conflict. Devoting herself to 
peace and reconciliation, she established the clois­
ter of Dragon's Rest as a safe haven from violence. 
Living in human guise, Runara now serves as the 
leader of a tiny group of hermits and ascetics. 
But the ageless conflict between chromatic and 
metallic dragons threatens to disrupt the serenity 
of Dragon's Rest-and this is where the adven­
ture begins! AD VENTURE OU TLI NE 
In Dragons of Stormwreck Isle, the characters expe­
rience the magical scars left behind by the death of 
dragons. Faced with the evil schemes of one living 
dragon and the righteous anger of another, they'll 
have the chance to explore whether peace between 
the feuding dragon families is possible-or if they 
must resort to violence to resolve the conflict on 
this isle. 
This adventure has four chapters: 
Chapter 1, "Dragon's Rest," introduces Runara's 
cloister and its inhabitants and provides the char­
acters the opportunity to learn about the problems 
facing the island. It also describes additional 
encounters you can use in the course of the adven­
ture, including a magical hot spring with mysteri­
ous guardians at the site of a brass dragon's death. 
Chapter 2, "Seagrow Caves," describes how the 
grave of Sharruth spawns magical connections to 
the Elemental Plane of Fire that threaten a com­
munity of mushroom-like myconids. 
Chapter 3, "Cursed Shipwreck," details a ship that 
crashed alongside the bones of a gold dragon and 
the horrible curse within the ship's hold. 
Chapter 4, "Clifftop Observatory," brings the char­
acters to the site where Runara killed a blue 
dragon-and where that blue dragon's grandson 
has made his lair. There they'll also find a bronze 
wyrmling who rejected Runara's teachings of 
peace, now held prisoner in the blue dragon's lair. 
AD VENTURE MAPS 
The maps in this booklet are for the DM's eyes only. 
These maps show secret doors and other elements 
the players aren't meant to see. 
When the characters arrive at a location marked 
on a map, describe it to give them a clear mental 
picture of the location. You can also draw what they 
see on paper, copying what's on your map while 
omitting secret details. It's not important that your 
hand-drawn map perfectly match what's in the 
printed adventure. Try to get the basic shape and 
dimensions correct and leave the rest to the players' 
imaginations. 
TH E DU NGEON MASTER 
The Dungeon Master has a special role in 
D&D games. 
The DM is a storyteller. The DM presents the 
challenges and encounters that the characters must 
overcome. The DM is the players' interface to the 
D&D world, who reads (and sometimes also writes) 
the adventure and describes what happens in re­
sponse to the characters' actions. 
The DM is a referee. When it's not clear what 
ought to happen next, the DM decides how to apply 
the rules and keep the story going. 
The DM is a roleplayer. The DM plays the mon­
sters in the adventure, choosing their actions and 
rolling dice for their attacks. The DM also plays 
all the other people the characters meet, including 
helpful ones. 
DM TIPS 
The most important part of being a good DM is facil­
itating the fun of everyone at the table. Keep these 
tips in mind to help things go smoothly: 
Embrace the shared story. D&D is about telling a 
story as a group, so let the players contribute to 
the outcome through the words and deeds of their 
characters. If some players are reluctant to speak 
up, ask them what their characters are doing. 
It's not a competition. The DM isn't competing 
against the player characters. Your job is to 
referee the rules, run monsters, and keep the 
story moving. 
Be fair and flexible. Treat your players in a fair, im­
partial manner. The rules help you do this, but you 
can make your own rulings to ensure everyone is 
having fun. 
Modify the adventure to suit your tastes. The ad­
venture has no prescribed outcome. You can alter 
any encounter to make it more interesting and fun 
for your players. 
Keep a notepad handy. Use it to track details such 
as the characters' and monsters' initiative order. 
SHA RING INFORMATION 
As Dungeon Master, one of your most important 
tasks is figuring out how much to tell the players 
and when. All the information the players need to 
make choices comes from you. Within the rules of 
the game and the limits of the characters' knowl­
edge and senses, tell players every thing they 
need to know. 
RUNNING THE ADVENTU RE Text that appears in a box like this is meant to be 
read aloud or paraphrased to the players when their 
characters first arrive at a location or under a specific 
circumstanc e, as described in the text. It usually de­
scribes locatio ns or presents scripted dialogue, so the 
players know what's up and have a sense of what their 
characters' options are. 
You don't have to reveal every aspect of a situation 
or hazard in one go. Boxed text typically describes 
everything the characters see, hear, or smell at first 
glance. As characters search rooms, make Wisdom 
(Perception ) or Intelligence (Investigation) checks, 
open drawers and chests, and generally examine 
things more close ly, give players more details about 
what their characters find. 
Creature Stat Blocks. Whenever the adventure 
text presents a creature's name ip. bold type, that's a 
visual cue directing you to the creature's stat block 
in appendix B. Those stat blocks are intended for 
your eyes only. However, as the characters fight 
monsters, you can reveal certain information to help 
them make smart choices in combat: 
Hit Points. You can give players a sense of how 
well they're doing against a creature by describ­
ing, in narrative terms, how hurt the creature is. 
For example, if the creature has fewer than half 
its hit points remaining, you can describe it as 
being badly wounded. Such information gives the 
players a sense of progress and might spur them 
to press the attack. On the other hand, if the char­
acters aren't damaging the creature much, let the 
players know that the creature looks like it can 
take a lot more punishment. That might encour­
age the players to change their plan. 
Abilities, Strengths, and Weaknesses. As they 
fight a creature, characters should learn more 
about the creature's abilities. Share information 
with the players as it becomes apparent. For ex­
ample, if the wizard casts flaming sphere (a spell 
that deals fire damage) against a fire snake (a crea­
ture that's immune to fire damage), let the wiz­
ard's player know the spell doesn't seem to bother 
the creature at all. Players might correctly guess 
that a fire snake probably isn't harmed by fire; feel 
free to subtly confirm their guesses (perhaps smil­
ing and saying, "That sounds reasonable"). 
Story Information. A location description might 
include important information not in boxed text. 
Often you're meant to reveal such information when 
the characters examine particular areas or interact 
with creatures. 
STORMWRECK ISLE 
MAP , : 5TORMWRECK ls LE 
As the DM, you roleplay the creatures that the 
characters encounter. The adventure offers guid­
ance to help you decide what these creatures know 
and how willing they are to share information with 
the characters. Beyond that, improvise and bring 
these creatures to life as best you can. For exam­
ple, the adventure describes Runara (the disguised 
bronze dragon who leads the cloister of Dragon's 
Rest) as wise and peace-loving, but you get to decide 
what her voice sounds like and how she reacts to a 
given situation. You can also ignore what the text 
says and roleplay Runara or any other creature as 
you see fit. 
Treasure. When characters find treasure, tell 
them how many coins they find and how much 
any gems and art objects are worth. Sometimes 
treasure includes magic items, whose names are 
presented in italic type. Appendix A describes these 
items and their properties, as well as the rules for 
how characters figure out what a magic item does. 
MA KING MIST AKES 
Dungeon Masters are fallible, just like everyone 
else, and even experienced DMs make mistakes. 
If you overlook, forget, or misrepresent something, 
correct yourself and move on. No one expects you 
to memorize every part of this adventure and all the 
rules in the rulebook. As long as your players are 
having fun, everything will be just fine. IMPROV ISING ABILITY CHECKS 
The adventure often tells you what ability checks 
characters might try in certain situations and the 
Difficulty Class (DC) of those checks. But some­
times characters try things that the adventure can't 
anticipate. In that case, you decide how to handle it. 
Ability checks are for situations where a charac­
ter's success or failure isn't guaranteed. If anyone 
can easily accomplish a task, don't ask for an abil­
ity check. Just tell the player what happens. And if 
there's no way anyone could accomplish the task, 
just tell the player it doesn't work. 
When you decide an ability check is required, con­
sult the "Ability Checks" section of the rulebook and 
the table of Typical Difficulty Classes. Most of the 
time, choose a DC that is easy (DC 10), moderate 
(DC 15), or hard (DC 20). 
RUN NING THE ADVENTURE 
CHAPTER 1 
DRAGON'S REST 
THE ADVENTURE BEGINS AT A TINY CLOISTER CALLED 
Dragon's Rest, a haven where world-weary people 
come to seek peace, reconciliation, and enlighten­
ment. There, the characters learn about the dangers 
facing Stormwreck Isle. 
Each character has a specific reason for coming 
to the cloister, as shown on the character sheets. 
You can also let players invent their own reasons for 
their characters to seek out Runara's wisdom and 
assistance. 
WE LCOME TO DRAGON'S REST 
Read the following text when you're ready to start: 
Your journey was uneventful, but the island now 
visible off the bow promises rare wonders. Seaweed 
shimm ers in countless brilliant colors below you, and 
rays of sunlight defy the overcast sky to illuminate the 
lush grass and dark basalt rock of the island. Avoid­
ing the rocks jutting up from the ocean, your ship 
makes its way toward a calm harbor on the island's 
north side. 
CHAPTER 1 I DRAGON'S RES T A large, open-air temple comes into view, perched 
on the edge of a cliff high above you. The ship drops 
anchor at the mouth of the harbor, and two sailors 
row you ashore. You have plenty of time to admire the 
towering statue at the center of the temple, depicting 
a wizened man surrounded by seven songbirds. A 
long path winds up the side of the cliff to the temple, 
dotted along the way with doorways cut into the rock. 
The sailors set you ashore on a rickety dock, where 
a large rowboat is neatly tied. They point to the base 
of the path and wish you good luck before they row 
back to the ship. Your visit to Dragon's Rest begins! 
Before continuing with the adventure, encourage 
the players to introduce their characters to each 
other if they haven't done so already. They might 
want to discuss their reasons for visiting Dragon's 
Rest, or they might prefer to keep their reasons se­
cret for now. If they have any questions about what 
they can see of the cloister from the boat, use map 
2 (on page 11) and the information in "Dragon's 
Rest Locations" to answer them. 
Ask the players to give you the party's marching 
order as they start toward the cloister. Who's in 
front, and who's bringing up the rear? Make a note 
of this marching order. 
When you're ready, continue with the "Drowned 
Sailors" section. 
DR OWN ED SAILORS 
Read the following text to start the encounter: 
As you're about to leave the beach and start your 
climb, you hear a ruckus of splashing and a wet, gur­
gling moan behind you. Three figures are shambling 
up from the water's edge, about thirty feet away. 
They're dressed as sailors, but their skin is gray and 
they look drowned. Sea water drools from their slack 
mouths as they lurch toward you. 
The three shambling sailors are zombies, the ani­
mated corpses of sailors who died in a recent ship­
wreck. The characters face a choice: they can turn 
and fight the zombies, or they can continue up the 
path and leave the slow, shambling zombies behind. 
If the characters turn and fight, this is the first 
combat encounter in the adventure. Here are the 
steps you should follow to run it: 
1. Review the zombie stat block in appendix B. 
2. Use the initiative rules in the rulebook to de­
termine who acts first, second, third, and so 
on. Keep track of everyone's initiative count on 
your notepad. 
3.On the zombies' initiative count, they move to­
ward the characters. If they get close enough, they
make melee attacks. The zombies' stat block con­
tains the information you need to resolve these
attacks. If all the characters are more than 20 feet
away, the zombies use the Dash action so they
can move farther. For more information on what
the zombies can do on their turn, see "Combat" in
the rulebook.
4.The zombies fight until they're all defeated.
Tip: Undead Fortitude. The zombies' Undead
Fortitude trait reflects how hard it is to kill these 
walking corpses. When this trait prevents a zombie 
from dying, give the players a hint about what hap­
pened. You might say, "That should have finished the creature off, but it refuses to stop moving!" On 
the flip side, any time a zombie takes radiant dam­
age (such as from the cleric's sacred flame cantrip), 
you might describe the creature howl ing in agony. 
This can help the players realize that radiant dam­
age is a way to get around Undead Fortitude. If the 
players ask whether their characters know anything 
about fighting zombies, have them make DC 10 In­
telligence checks. Those who succeed might recall 
that a particularly powerful blow (a critical hit) or 
radiant damage can help finish off a zombie. 
Runara's Aid. In the unlikely event that the zom­
bies defeat the adventurers, Runara comes to their 
rescue. The characters wake up in the temple (area 
AS in Dragon's Rest). Runara explains that she 
heard the sounds of combat and arrived just in time 
to prevent the zombies from dragging the characters 
into the sea. 
Avoiding the Zombies. If the characters decide 
not to fight the zombies, they easily escape from the 
slow, shambling monsters. The zombies don't follow 
them up the path toward Dragon's Rest. The char­
acters will have another opportunity to deal with 
the zombies later (see "Cloister Quests" later in this 
chapter). 
MEE TING THE INHAB IT ANTS 
Read this text when the characters first climb the 
path to Dragon's Rest: 
Your arrival quickly draws the atte ntion of the entire 
population of the place-which consists mostly of 
kobolds. These small, reptilian folk eye you curiously 
while a couple of humans watch from a distance. All 
the cloister's residents are dressed in simple clothes, 
and no one carries a visible weapon. One of the ko­
bolds pipes up with, "What's your name?" 
At that, all the kobolds begin barraging you with 
questions-"Wher e are you from?" "What's that?" 
"Why are you here?" and more that are lost in the din. 
Visitors to the cloister are rare, and the kobolds' cu­
riosity is insatiable; they keep asking questions until 
the characters insist they stop. 
When the characters quiet the kobolds (or if the 
players start showing signs of exasperation), the 
leader of the cloister approaches to welcome the 
characters. Read the following text: 
CHAPTER 1 I DRAGON'S RES T 
The chattering kobolds fall silent as a new figure 
comes into view, descending gracefully from the 
upper part of the cloister. She's an elderly human 
woman with weathered brown skin, white hair in tight 
braids, and kindly hazel eyes, dressed in a simple 
white robe. She smiles as she draws near and extends 
her arms in greeting. 
"Welcome to Dragon's Rest," she says. "May Baha­
mut's guidance lead you to whatever you seek." 
This is Elder Runara, the leader of Dragon's Rest. 
If the characters defeated the zombies at the beach, 
she thanks them for their service to the cloister. 
Even if they did not fight the zombies, she tells them 
they're welcome to stay at Dragon's Rest as long as 
they wish, sleeping either in one of the monastic 
cells (area Al) or in the temple (area AS) and eating 
with the rest of the community in the dining room 
(area A3). Runara says nothing about payment of 
any kind. If the characters offer to give money or 
perform services around the cloister in exchange for 
her hospitality, she accepts these gifts. 
Throughout this adventure, Dragon's Rest serves 
as a home base for the characters. All the places 
they'll explore on the island are within a few miles 
of the cloister, and they can return here whenever 
they wish to rest, heal, and get information they 
need for the next part of their adventures. In addi­
tion, they can buy any of the equipment described in 
the rulebook from Myla (see "Kobolds"). 
During their time at Dragon's Rest, the characters 
can interact with any of its residents. All the resi­
dents but Runara live in the small monastic cells cut 
into the cliff face (area Al on the cloister map). 
ELDER RU NARA 
Elder Runara is the leader of Dragon's Rest. She 
appears as a human woman, but she is actually an 
adult bronze dragon disguised in human form. She 
guides the residents of the cloister in their contem­
plation and study. The cloister's inhabitants know 
Runara's true identity, but they do not speak of it 
to visitors. 
Runara's initial attitude toward the characters is 
indifferent (see "Social Interaction" in the rulebook). 
She becomes friendly as soon as the characters 
demonstrate that they care about the cloister's 
safety, such as by fighting the zombies at the beach 
or undertaking any of the quests she offers them 
(see "Cloister Quests" later in this chapter). If the 
characters harm any of the residents of Dragon's 
Rest, she becomes hostile and insists the characters 
make amends for the harm they did before she is 
willing to deal with them in any way. 
CHA PTER 1 I DRAGON'S RES T Runara's mission is to help those whose lives have 
been shaped by violence find new paths forward in 
peace. Ultimately, she would like to see chromatic 
and metallic dragons find a peaceful way to coexist 
in the world. In the meantime, she finds comfort in 
helping humans and other people escape from cy­
cles of violence. 
Runara maintains a secret lair in a cave accessed 
by an undersea tunnel, a short distance from the 
cloister and not shown on the map of Dragon's Rest. 
She is careful not to enter or leave the cave when 
anyone might spot her, and she enters and emerges 
from the water in the open ocean, out of sight of the 
cloister. The other residents of the cloister think she 
lives in the temple at the top of the island (area AS), 
or they simply laugh away queries about her accom­
modations, explaining that she's always in the tem­
ple, or in the libr ary, or checking on the rest of the 
residents-she never seems to sleep! 
KOBOLDS 
Kobolds are small reptilian Humanoids who believe 
they are descended from dragons and gravitate to 
the service of dragons. Over the centuries, many 
bands of kobolds have been drawn to Stormwreck 
Isle by the lingering draconic magic that suffuses 
the island. Nine kobolds utterly devoted to Runara 
now live at Dragon's Rest. 
The kobolds of Dragon's Rest are lawful good, 
sharing Runara's ideals of justice and compassion. 
Since they are sensitive to sunlight, they work at 
night and avoid moving about during the day. Unless 
otherwise noted, the kobolds are initially friendly 
toward the adventurers. 
The kobolds are summarized below. They can 
provide comic relief, offer a down-to-earth perspec­
tive, or be a way for you to pass hints to the players 
if they're having trouble putting things together. But 
don't feel like you need to bring all nine of these 
kobolds to life! Pick one or two of these kobolds that 
you and the characters like the most and let them 
be the focus of the characters' interactions with 
the kobolds: 
Agga speaks little and has no patience for non­
sense. She keeps the rest of the kobolds organized 
and in line. She is indifferent toward visitors, but 
if the characters show respect for the cloister and 
help keep the more rambunctious kobolds in line, 
her attitude improves to friendly. 
Blepp has a sharp danger sense and is convinced 
he's supernaturally lucky. His prized possession is 
an ordinary dagger he claims is magical. 
Frub has limitless energy and desperately needs 
help finding productive directions to channel it. 
He loves to ask questions about everything other 
people are doing. 
EVER SIN CE AN UNFORTUNATE INCID ENT IN THE 
l<ITCHEN , LAYLEE IS NO LONGER ALLOWED TO 
HAN DLE MYLA'S ALCHEMI CAL FIRE. 
Kilnip has terrible insomnia and sleeps only a few 
hours each day. She is always tired but an eager 
conversat ionalist. 
Laylee has a curious mind and a talent for tools and 
building. She serves as Myla's helper. 
Mumpo is so audaciously courageous that he stole a 
copper piece from Runara's hoard. He's convinced 
she has no idea. (He is wrong, but Runara finds 
the situation amusing and lets Mumpo continue to 
believe in her ignorance.) 
Myla (lawful good kobold tinkerer) is a winged 
kobold whose brothers, Mek and Minn, now fol­
low Sparkrender, the blue wyrmling in Clifftop 
Observatory (see chapter 4). When Myla's wings 
were badly injured in an attack by stirges (which 
she describes as "hungry, icky, blood-sucking, bat­
things"), Runara helped in her recovery. Now Myla 
spends her time experimenting with alchemy, en­
gineering, and magic. 
Rix is pious and tends to the temple, acting as 
Runara's assistant. She adores puns. Rix recently 
witnessed a ship crashing on the rocks to the 
north (see "Cloister Quests" later in this chapter). 
Zark is rude and fond of colorful insults. His fa­
vorites are "Eat my sword, bugbear breath!" and 
"Your father was a gas spore!" He is indifferent 
toward visitors. TARAK 
Tarak is a human man in late middle age. He 
has pale skin tanned darker with many freckles, 
auburn hair and a beard that is mostly gray, and 
gray-blue eyes. Faded tattoos in an abstract design 
peek up the side of his neck from beneath his dirt­
stained robes. 
An avid botanist, Tarak tends the cloister's garden 
plots, growing flowers, herbs, and vegetables. He is 
soft spoken and helpful, eager to share his knowl­
edge of herbalism. But his kindly demeanor belies 
his past as a ruthless poisoner for a thieves' guild. 
After his work led to the death of his lover, he fled 
the guild and plans to spend the rest of his life aton­
ing for his past evils. 
Tarak is initially friendly toward visitors, but if a 
character pries into his past, his attitude shifts­
first to indifferent, then to hostile if the character 
continues to push. When he's hostile, his demeanor 
becomes cold and clipped, and he avoids the charac­
ters if he can. 
A gold hangman's noose is worked into the design 
of Tarak's visible tattoos. A character who studies 
the tattoos and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence 
(History) check recognizes the mark as a symbol 
associated with the Gilded Gallows, a thieves' guild 
that operates in a country far to the southeast called 
Elturgard. A character with the criminal back­
ground automatically succeeds on this check. Tarak 
does not willingly discuss the details of his past 
with anyone but trusted friends. 
Tarak frequently visits the sea caves on the south 
side of the island to acquire heart cap mushrooms 
from the myconids that live there. He uses the 
mushrooms to make potions of healing. But the my­
conids have installed a fearsome guardian at their 
caves-a fungus-covered octopus monster-that has 
turned him away on his latest visits, and he is wor­
ried (see "Cloister Quests"). 
VARNOTH 
Varnoth is a human woman whose frame, once 
tightly muscled, has thinned with age. Her black 
hair is cropped close to her scalp, and her light 
brown skin bears many scars-one of which runs 
across her left eye, which is milky and blind. An ele­
gant prosthetic made from wood and metal replaces 
her right leg below the knee. 
Varnoth was a feared general at the head of a mer­
cenary company called the Azure Wolves. Age and 
battle have taken a toll on her, and she is spending 
her twilight years in reflective contemplation at 
Dragon's Rest. Her demeanor is gruff, but she is ob­
servant and empathetic. Above all, Varnoth believes 
in second chances and redemption. 
Varnoth has a set of mason's tools that she uses to 
maintain the temple and other areas of the cloister. 
CHAP TER 1 I DRAGON'S RES T 
While working in the temple recently, she witnessed 
a ship change course and crash into the rocks to the 
north (see "Cloister Quests"). 
Varnoth is indifferent to visitors, but a character 
can shift her attitude to friendly by engaging her in 
conversation on her favorite topics: history, ethics, 
and the impact of individual actions on the world. 
A character who learns Varnoth's name and 
succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (History) check 
recalls hearing of General Varnoth Wender and the 
Azure Wolves, which was a mighty force in the east 
about a decade ago. A character with the soldier 
background succeeds on this check automaticall y. 
DR AGON 'S RES T LO CATIONS 
The following locations are keyed to map 2, which 
shows the layout of Dragon's Rest. 
Al: PATH AND MO NASTIC CELLS 
A long path leads from the rocky shore up the side 
of the cliff , with occasional stairs to ease the ascent. 
Here and there along the lower part of the path, 
well-tended garden plots hold flowers, herbs, and 
vegeta bles. 
About thirty feet above the bay, the path widens into 
a long plaza. Halfway along the plaza, a stone statue 
of a dragon gazes serenely down the path. Six open 
doorways are cut into the cliff side. 
Statue. The star-in-a-circle symbol on the map 
represents the dragon statue. A character who 
examines the statue and succeeds on a DC 10 In­
telligence (Arcana) check recognizes that it depicts 
a bronze dragon-a member of the metallic family. 
If characters ask Runara about the statue, she tells 
them it depicts Astalagan, who died on these cliffs 
centuries ago. She doesn't tell them that Astalagan 
was her father. 
Cells. The doorways lead into simple monastic 
cells occupied by the cloister residents. Each cell 
is furnished with a bed, a nightstand, a small desk, 
and a chair. 
The westernmost cell is vacant, and it is available 
to the characters if they don't mind sharing the 
space. Next to it is Tarak's cell, then Varnoth's. The 
fourth cell is Myla's, cluttered with junk and tools. 
The fifth and sixth cells are strung with hammocks, 
offering space for the other eight kobolds to sleep. A2 : WI NCH HOUSE 
A small, free-standing building halfway up the path 
has a peaked roof and a weathered wooden door. A 
sturdy wood en pallet wrapped with rope hangs be­
neath the building on an iron chain, lying flat against 
the cliff face. 
Inside the building is a winch that allows the 
pallet to be lowered down to the water, 50 feet 
below. When boats deliver supplies to the cloister, 
the residents use this pallet to haul goods both 
up and down. 
A lever locks the winch in place. If a character 
pulls the lever, the pallet falls down to the water and 
floats there. As an action, a character can operate 
the winch to pull the pallet back up 10 feet. 
A3 : KITCHEN 
A doorway in the rock opens into a dining room with 
a long table. Two benches run the length of the table, 
and a single chair sits at the table 's head. A short hall­
way connects to a small, tidy kitchen. 
The cloister residents share three daily meals here. 
They take turns cooking and cleaning up after 
meals. Nobody says it out loud, but the days when 
Tarak cooks are everyone's favorite. 
A4 : LIBRARY 
Of all the doorways cut into the cliff face, only one 
has an actual door. This entry's door is made of 
sturdy oak with iron bands, and it swings open easily 
to reveal a spacious library. Booksh elves line every 
wall, with three free-standing shelves in the west 
half of the room. In the east half is a table with two 
benches, writing implements, book stands, and glass­
shielded lamps. 
The cloister library holds books and scrolls cover­
ing a variety of topics, but focused on theology and 
history. Runara spends nearly half her time in here, 
studying, copying, and annotating the library's col­
lection. Tarak and Varnoth also come here to read 
and discuss various works. Many of the kobolds visit 
as well, but mostly for the quiet; only Myla could be 
described as studious. 
MAP 2: DRAGO N'S REST 
A5: TEMPLE OF BAHAM UT 
The highest point of the cloister is crowned by an 
open-air temple that overhangs the cliff, supported 
by arched stone struts anchored to the cliff face. The 
north wall of the temple is carved directly into the 
rock, while the rest is open to the sea air. Heavy pillars 
mark the three open sides, supporting the wooden 
roof. In the center of the temple stands a stone statue 
of a kind-looking old man with canaries perched on
his hands, should ers, and head. A feeling of serenity 
suffuses the place. 
The temple is very simple, with the statue (repre­
sented by the star-in-a-circle symbol on the map) as 
its only furnishing. The statue depicts Bahamut, the 
Platinum Dragon, in mortal disguise, surrounded 
by seven canaries that represent gold dragons who 
accompan y him on his travels. A character who 
examines the statue and succeeds on a DC 10 In­
telligence (Religion ) check recognizes Bahamut, 
and any resident of Dragon's Rest identifies the 
god if asked. Depressions in the statue's pedestal at the four 
cardinal directions hold offerings of incense made 
to Bahamut. Runara spends about half her time 
here, tending and maintaining the temple, offering 
prayers and incense, or in quiet contemplation. 
Other residents of the cloister help her, most often 
Varnoth and the kobold Rix. 
The feeling of serenity that pervades the temple 
is the result of protective magic. A non-evil creature 
who makes a saving throw within the temple can 
roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the saving 
throw. If a character casts detect magic in the tem­
ple, the spell reveals a faint aura around the statue. 
Runara is the only inhabitant of Dragon's Rest who 
knows that this is a lingering effect of the death of a 
dragon on this site-her father, Astalagan. 
About Bahamut. Known as the Platinum Dragon, 
Bahamut is the patron and progenitor of metallic 
dragons. Adventurers and dragons alike pray to 
Bahamut to uphold honor and justice, or when they 
need courage to face a great threat. He seldom in­
terferes in the affairs of mortal creatures, though he 
makes exceptions to help thwart the machinations 
of Tiamat the Dragon Queen and the evil dragons 
that serve her. 
CHAPTER 1 \ DRAGON'S RES T 
CLOIS TER QU ESTS 
As the characters explore Dragon's Rest, the resi­
dents talk with them about the problems the cloister 
is facing. These conversations are opportunities for 
you to introduce the players to the adventures that 
await them in the sea caves, the shipwreck, and the 
ancient observatory. 
This adventure is designed to be flexible and give 
the players the sense that they're in charge of their 
destiny on Stormwreck Isle. Ideally, the characters 
will spend time at Dragon's Rest and then explore 
both Seagrow Caves (described in chapter 2) and 
the wreck of Compass Rose (chapter 3). They can 
choose where to go first. After they've explored 
both of those sites, they should be ready to face 
Sparkrender in the Clifftop Observatory (chapter 4). 
Each character sheet includes a personal goal for 
that character. Some of those goals are concrete­
the wizard, for example, is eager to learn the secrets 
of Cliff top Observatory. Others are more general 
and might be fulfilled gradually over the course 
of the adventure-both the paladin and the fighter 
gaining a better understanding of their role in the 
world, for example. Use those goals (described un­
der "Individual Quests" below) to help the players 
bring their characters to life as they interact with 
Runara and the other residents of Dragon's Rest. 
ZOMBIE RESUR GENCE 
If the adventurers did not fight the zombies when 
they first arrived on the island, the zombies cause 
trouble later. After the characters have spent some 
time at the cloister, they hear cries for help. Read 
the following text: 
Two residents of Dragon's Rest are running for their 
lives up the lower path, their fishing equipment dis­
carded behind them. Blood and dirt stain their robes. 
Three figures shamble after them-blo ated corpses 
dressed as sailors, moaning and gurgling. 
The characters have another opportunity to fight 
the three zombies, this time with the lives of two 
new acquaintances-Blepp the kobold and Tarak 
the human gardener-hanging in the balance. See 
"Drowned Sailors" for help getting the encoun­
ter started. 
Blepp has 2 hit points left after a zombie hit him, 
and he is convinced that his good luck and his "mag­
ical" dagger saved him from certain death. Tarak is 
unarmed, and the zombies overpower both him and 
Blepp if the characters don't help. 
CHAPTER 1 I DRA GON'S RES T If the characters talk to Runara about the zom­
bies, she tells them she suspects a wrecked ship off 
the rocks to the north is the source of these mon­
sters, and she asks the characters to investigate the 
site (see "Shipwreck" below). 
MORE ZOMBIES 
If the characters defeated the zombies when they 
first arrived on the island, you can use this encoun­
ter at any point during the adventure to add a little 
extra combat spice to the characters' lives. If the 
characters have already reached 2nd level, you can 
use from four to six zombies to give them a good 
challenge. 
SEA CA VES 
Tarak is eager to reestablish contact with the myco­
nids of the sea caves. He asks the characters to visit 
the caves, find out what's wrong with the myconids, 
and bring him back some heart cap mushrooms. He 
warns them about the fungal octopus the myconids 
have created as a guardian and tells them they'll 
probably have to fight the creature to gain access to 
the caves. He also give s them a foul-smelling sack of 
food scraps they can give the myconids as a gesture 
of friendship. Finally, he gives them two potions of 
healing (described in appendix A). 
SHIP WRE CK 
Several ships have recently crashed on the rocks 
north of Dragon's Rest and sunk with no survivors, 
and a few days ago both Varnoth and the kobold Rix 
witnessed the most recent wreck. They saw the ship 
abruptly veer off course and crash into the rocks, 
and they suggest the characters might help the is­
land by discovering what caused the crash. If the 
characters ask Runara about it, she suggests that 
the answer is likely to be found on an older wreck­
the wreck of Compass Rose. 
INDIVID UAL UES TS 
As described on the character sheets, the characters 
have their own reasons for visiting Dragon's Rest. 
THE CLERIC 
The cleric was led here by a recurring dream involv­
ing the shadow of death. If the character talks to 
Runara about the dream or their quest, Runara lis­
tens closely, then pauses to think. "Well," she says, 
"I am no expert on interpreting dreams, but perhaps 
the zombies you fought are the 'hunger of death' 
you spoke of." She points the character toward the 
wreck of Compass Rose (see "Shipwreck" above) to 
investigate further. 
THE FIGHTER 
The fighter has come to Dragon's Rest in the hope 
that Runara can help the character understand the 
sense of destiny that weighs on their shoulders. If 
the character talks to Runara about this on first 
arriving at the cloister, Runara invites the character 
to consider how their reaction to the zombies on the 
beach might reflect their destiny-or not. If the char­
acter talks to Runara after having completed one or 
more of the adventure's quests, she encourages the 
character to consider whether their heroic actions 
might be the first manifestations of that destiny 
taking shape. At the end of the adventure, Runara 
encourages the character to continue on their path: 
"If your destiny is not clear to you yet, I'm confident 
it soon will be." 
THE PALADIN 
Disillusioned with the corruption of Neverwi nter, 
the paladin comes to Dragon's Rest seeking rest 
and new resolve. Runara welcomes the character 
and encourages them to talk to Tarak and Varnoth, 
who both know about escaping lives of corruption 
and violence. She also encourages the paladin 
to spend time in the temple of Bahamut. At the 
end of the adventure, she asks the paladin if they 
have learned anything about how to live in a world 
plagued with such corruption. If the character has 
no answer, she suggests, "Perhaps your adven­
tures here have shown you a way to combat evil on 
your own terms. Perhaps other such adventures 
await you." 
THE ROGUE 
The rogue comes to Dragon's Rest in search of a 
lost fortune suppose dly secreted away on the island 
by a member of the Gilded Gallows. The thieves' 
guild member in question is Tarak, who did in fact 
betray the guild, though the story has been twisted 
in the retelling. Tarak's last assignment for the guild 
.. RU NARA SAVES THE DAY! 
Runara is a powerful dragon, but she is dedicated to 
the cause of peace. She's not interested in fighting the 
battles that the characters might get thems elves into, 
but she keeps an eye on them, and she can rescue 
them if things go badly for them on the island. 
If any encounter on the island ends with all the 
characters unconscious, you can have the char acters 
awaken in the temple (area AS), with some of the ko­
bolds tending to their wounds. Runara prefers not to 
explain how she rescued the characters. 
If this happens mor e than once, the characters might 
need extra assistance. If you haven't already, con sider 
asking one or mor e players to play an additional char­
acter as a sidekick. You can explain that these addi­
tional characters have just arrived at Dragon's Rest 
and are eager to help. 
.. was to assassinate a traitor, who was his lover. The 
two tried to flee Elturgard together, but his lover was 
killed by another assassin. Tarak escaped, but no 
treasure was involved. If the rogue asks him about 
it, he explains he has left the life of crime-and sug­
gests perhaps it's time for the rogue to do the same. 
THE WIZARD 
The wizard carries a letter from a colleague about 
lost knowledge held in the Clifftop Observatory (see 
chapter 4). If asked about the observatory, Runara 
says, "Many have sought the knowledge contained 
in that place. I can direct you there, but first you 
need to show me you are worthy." She promises 
to direct the wizard to the observatory after the 
characters help deal with the other problems on 
the island. 
LOS T WY RMLING 
When the characters have proven themselves trust­
worthy and competent by dealing with the zombies, 
the myconids, and the shipwreck, Runara decides 
it's time to confide in them. She summons them to 
the temple (area AS). Read the following text when 
the characters arrive: 
Elder Runara smiles as you approach. "I have some­
thing to show you," she says. There's a Aash like a 
silent stroke of lightning, and the human woman 
is gone. In her place is an enormous dragon with 
bronze-c olored scales. "Now you see me as I truly 
am," she says, tilting her head with an expression that 
might be a smile on her scaled face. 
"As you have discovered, this island has many old 
wounds. And I'm afraid the cycle of violenc e is start­
ing again. I have one more favor to ask you." 
Runara outlines the history summarized in the "Ad­
venture Background" section and explains that each 
site the characters visited is linked to the death of a 
dragon. Then she tells them that a bronze wyrmling 
named Aidron came to the island a few months ago 
and studied with her at Dragon's Rest. Five days 
before the characters' arrival, he argued with her, 
angrily rejected her teaching of peace, and stormed 
away from the cloister. She fears he went to the an­
cient observatory on the southeast side of the island, 
which is another dragon's final resting place. She 
suspects some evil has arisen there, but says she 
dares not go there herself, lest her presence reopen 
old wounds. She gives them a moonstone key-a 
3-inch-long, 1-inch-wide hexagonal prism made 
from moonstone, with a dragon's head engraved on 
one end-and explains that they'll need it to access 
the observatory. 
CHAPTER 1 I DRA GON 'S RE ST
EXP LORI NG THE ISLAND 
This adventure presents Dragon's Rest and three 
adventure locations in detail, but Stormwreck Isle 
holds the possibility of excitement and danger 
beyond those sites. While the characters travel 
between locations on the island, or if they set out 
to explore the island, they might stumble across 
fantastical creatures and locations that provide an 
extra challenge on their journey. 
ADDITION AL ENCO UNTERS 
Place these encounters wherever you want to on the 
island, or use them as inspiration as you begin to 
craft your own adventures. 
HOT SPRINGS HA VOC 
This encounter poses a simple challenge for charac­
ters of 2nd level or higher, or a harder challenge for 
1st-level characters. It's particularly appropriate if 
the characters are rowing around the island or mak­
ing their way along the coast at sea level. 
Billowing clouds of steam emerge from the rocks 
ahead, and the air grows thicker with moisture. As 
you round a bend, you see a cove where a hot spring 
burbles up from the rocks and spills into a pool before 
draining into the ocean. The turquoi se water is lumi­
nescent, and the gray basalt edges of the spring are 
lined with vibrantly colored mushrooms, which occa­
sionally burst in a shower of rainbow spores. 
Not immedia tely visible to the characters are the 
guardians of the spring: three fume drakes. These 
mischievous creatures are initially indifferent to the 
characters and ignore their arrival, but if anyone 
attempts to gather mushrooms or enter the water 
of the hot spring, the fume drakes become hostile, 
emerging from the water to attack the group. A 
character who examines the water and succeeds on 
a DC 10 Wisdom (Perceptio n) check spots the shim­
mering outlines of the fume drakes in the water. 
Spri ng Wa ters. The spring is the site of a brass 
dragon's death, and life-giving magic persists at the 
site. A character who spends 10 minutes bathing 
in the waters of the spring can roll one of their Hit 
Dice (noted on each character sheet) and regain hit 
points equal to the roll plus their Constitution mod­
ifier. A character can benefit from bathing in the hot 
spring at most once per day. 
Treasure. A character who examines the mush­
rooms lining the spring and succeeds on a DC 15 
Intelligence (Nature) check identifies these mush­
rooms as wind spores-a rare fungus with a unique 
magical property. When a creature squeezes a wind 
CHAPTER 1 I DRAGON'S RES T spore mushroom's cap, it releases a small cloud 
of spores. For 1 hour, the creature doesn't need 
to breathe, as the spores provide it with oxygen. A 
wind spore is worth 30 gp, and at any given time 
2d4 wind spores are ready to be harvested. 
THERE , THERE , 0W LBEAR 
This encounter poses a medium challenge for 3rd­
level characters and a difficult challenge for 2nd­
level characters. Use it if your group enjoys combat 
or the players need a chance to practice using their 
characters' new abilities after gaining a level. It's 
particular ly appropriate if the characters are travel­
ing across the island rather than following the coast. 
A discordant sound-half a low growl, half a piercing 
screech-rips through the air. Abruptly, a hulking 
creature comes into view. A mix of purple feathers and 
deep brown fur covers its bearlike body, and its large 
eyes stare hungrily at you from its owlish head. 
This owlb ear is hostile toward the characters. It 
views them as intruders in its territory, though its 
goal is to drive them away rather than kill them. 
Originally a part of a performing troupe, the owl­
bear was stranded here after the ship carrying the 
troupe crashed on the northern rocks. 
Any character within 5 feet of the owlbear notices 
a small wooden whistle hanging around its neck. 
This whistle was (and still can be) used to train 
and command the owlbear. A character within 5 
feet of the owlbear can use their action to attempt 
to grab the whistle. If the character succeeds on 
a DC 12 Strength check, the whistle comes free. 
With the whistle in hand, a character can take an 
action to blow into it and make a DC 10 Wisdom 
(Animal Handling) check. On a success, the owlbear 
calms and immedia tely becomes friendly toward 
the whistle holder and indifferent toward the other 
characters. However, it won't leave the area it now 
considers its territory, and any attempt to force it to 
leave makes it hostile again. 
KOBOLD RENEG ADES 
This encounter is a difficult challenge for 1st-level 
characters and can be scaled up for 2nd-or 3rd-level 
characters as noted below. It's appropriate whenever 
characters are travel ing around the island by land. 
A group of kobolds tries to ambush the charac­
ters. They're hiding in the rocks and light foliage, 
hoping to get the jump on the adventurers. Make 
a Dexterity (Stealth) check for the kobolds, rolling 
once for all of them and using the Dexterity modifier 
(+2) of the wingless kobolds. Compare the result 
to the characters' passive Wisdom (Perception ) 
scores. Any character whose score is lower than 
the kobolds' check result is surprised and loses 
their turn during the first round of combat (see 
"Surprise" in the rulebook ). Read this text when the 
kobolds attack: lA yipping sound erupts around you as angry kobolds l
emerge from their hiding places and attack! 
Four kobolds and one winged kobold (all lawful 
evil) participate in this ambush. These cruel, vicious 
kobolds reject both the peaceful teaching of Runara 
and the tyrannical rule of Sparkrender , and they 
prey on travelers who stray away from Dragon's 
Rest. They haven't had much success and are des­
perate, so they're hostile and fight to the death. 
Their desperation means that they can easily be 
persuaded to stop fighting with an offer of money or 
food. Otherwise, they're not interested in conversa­
tion or negotiation. 
2nd-Level Characters. If the characters are 2nd 
level, use six kobolds and two winged kobolds. 
3rd -Level Charac ters . If the characters are 3rd 
level, use eight kobolds and three winged kobolds. WH AT LIES BENEA TH 
As described in the "Adventure Background" 
section in the introduction, Stormwreck Isle was 
formed from magic-fueled volcanic activity in the 
tomb of a monstrous red dragon named Sharruth. 
Some legends and rumors suggest Sharruth is 
not actually dead, merely imprisoned beneath the 
island, and the activity in Seagrow Caves suggests 
that all is not well beneath Stormwreck Isle. 
You can devise your own adventures around char­
acters investigating Sharruth's tomb. Characters 
might scour the island until they find hidden vents 
they can use to access winding tunnels leading deep 
into the earth. More fume drakes and fire snakes 
might lurk below. Perhaps there's even a group of 
kobolds who serve mighty Sharruth. 
Such an adventure is yours to devise, and you 
can put your unique spin on what the characters do 
and discover there. Of course, if you're not ready 
to craft an expedition into the caverns beneath the 
island, then the characters simply don't discover 
those subterranean passages no matter how much 
they search. 
CHAP TER 1 I DRAGON'S REST 
CHAPTER 2 
SEAGROW CAVES 
Turs CHAPTER ASS UMES THE CHARACTERS COME 
here before going to the wreck of Compass Rose, 
and they are still 1st level. It also includes sim­
ple instructions to scale up the danger in combat 
encounters if the characters complete chapter 3, 
"Cursed Shipwreck," before coming here, and are 
now 2nd level. 
CAVES OVER VIE W 
The sea caves on the southwest side of Storm­
wreck Isle are inhabited by an unusual colony of 
myconids-fungus people who normally live deep 
underground. Though they can't abide sunlight, 
these myconids used to welcome visitors now and 
then. In particular, they traded with Tarak from 
Dragon's Rest, giving him rare fungi that grow in 
their caves in exchange for food scraps and other 
waste from the cloister, which nourished the fungi 
in the caves. Recently, though, the myconids have 
rejected Tarak's visits and placed a monstrous 
guardian at the entrance to their caves that keeps 
all visitors away. 
The reason for this sudden shift in the myconids' 
behavior is that a blight has spread through the 
CHAPTER 2 I SEAGROW CAVEScaves and is poisoning the myconids, twisting their 
gardens, and even laying low their leader, Sinensa. 
The source of the blight is the tomb of the red 
dragon Sharruth deep beneath the island. Noxious 
fumes from the dragon's tomb normally filter up 
through the rock and vent to the surface through a 
cavern at the back of Seagrow Caves that the myco­
nids avoid, but the vent has become blocked, and the 
fumes have spilled into the myconids' caves. 
Besides this insidious poison, visitors to Seagrow 
Caves must face one additional threat: the stirges 
that nest in the caves. These blood-sucking mon­
sters aren't much of a threat individually and don't 
bother the bloodless myconids, but they can be 
deadly in large numbers. 
SEAGROW CAVES FEA TURES 
The caves have the following features: 
Ceilings. Unless noted otherwise, the ceilings in the 
caverns are 20 feet high, and the tunnels connect­
ing the caverns are 15 feet high. 
Light. The interior caves are illuminated by biolumi­
nescent fungi, which provide dim light throughout 
the area. See "Vision" in the rulebook. 
Walls. The cave walls are formed from hexagonal 
columns of dark gray basalt-volcanic rock origi­
nating from Sharruth's undersea tomb. The walls 
provide hand-and footholds, so climbing the walls 
doesn't require an ability check. 
Fumes. Toxic volcanic fumes from deep below the 
island are slowly poisoning the fungi in the caves. 
A faint smell of sulfur pervades the place, grow­
ing stronger the closer one gets to area B6. If the 
characters take a long rest inside the caves before 
opening the vent in B6, each character must suc­
ceed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be­
come poisoned (see "Conditions" in the rulebook). 
The lesser restoration spell ends this effect, as 
does finishing a long rest in fresh air. 
RU NNING TH IS CH APTER 
Once the characters decide to visit Seagrow Caves, 
they have two options for reaching the site: 
By Boat. Dragon's Rest has a rowboat the charac­
ters can take around the western end of the is­
land. (This is Tarak's preferred method.) The trip 
to Seagrow Caves is 5 miles, which takes about 3 
hours and 20 minutes to row. 
Along the Coast. Walking around the coast of the 
island is a little easier than rowing, even though 
it's farther because the characters have to walk 
around the bays instead of rowing across them. 
The 7-mile trip takes only 2 hours and 20 minutes 
at a normal walking pace. The characters can 
choose whether they want to walk on the cliffs 
high above the sea or pick their way among the 
tide pools at the base of the cliffs. The lower route 
is available only at low tide (see the Tides table). 
APPR OAC HING AT SEA LEVEL 
If the characters arrive at Seagrow Caves at sea 
level, read the following text: 
A cliff of dark gray stone towers two hundred feet 
above the crashing waves, which rush in and out of a 
yawning cave mouth. A swirling slick of colors dances 
on the water's surface, emanating from the cave. 
APPR OAC HING FROM ABO VE 
If the party approaches from above, read this text: 
An opening gapes in the cliff face two hundred feet 
below you, like a mouth drinking in the cras hing 
waves. Two natural stairways formed of stone col­
umns offer ways down the cliffs. ENTERING THE CAVES 
At high tide, the 40-foot-high tunnel (area Bl) is 
flooded all the way to area B2. The natural stair­
ways, which are not shown on the map of Seagrow 
Caves, descend the cliffs into the sea. The charac­
ters can either wait for low tide or row or swim into 
the tunnel. At low tide, a 5-foot-wide pathway is 
exposed along the base of the cliffs and the edge of 
the tunnel. 
The tides shift every 6 hours, as summarized on 
the Tides table. 
TIDES 
Time Tide 
Midnight to sunrise Low 
Sunrise to noon High 
Noon to sunset Low 
Sunset to midnight High 
INTERA CTING WITH MYC ONIDS 
The myconids' initial attitude toward outsiders is 
hostile (see "Social Interaction" in the rulebook ). 
They aren't malicious, though, and they don't resort 
to violence immediately. Adults use their Rapport 
Spores to telepathically warn visitors to leave. (See 
"Rapport Spores" below for details about this form 
of communication.) Sprouts flee toward the nearest 
adults to warn them of intruders. If the characters 
attack, the myconids defend themselves. 
To convince a hostile myconid to converse or to 
allow the characters to do anything other than leave 
the caves, a character must succeed on a DC 20 
Charisma check. Depending on the character's ap­
proach, the Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion 
skill can apply to the check. Mentioning Tarak's 
name or presenting the offering he sent the myco­
nids grants advantage on this check. 
An indifferent myconid is willing to explain what 
is going on in Seagrow Caves. The sprouts know 
only that their leader, Sinensa, has fallen ill-and 
that a nasty smell pervades their caves. Adult my­
coriids know that the "crystal cave" (area B6) is the 
source of the foul odor and that Sinensa fell ill after 
going into that cave to investigate the issue. The 
myconids normally avoid that cave because sunlight 
filters into it by way of the vent at the western end of 
the cave, and even diffuse sunlight is unpleasant to 
these cave-dwelling creatures. 
RAPP ORT SPORES 
A myconid's Rapport Spores ability allows all in­
telligent creatures in the area to communicate tele­
pathically with each other. The characters and the 
myconids are effectively speaking thoughts at each 
other. This effect doesn't allow any creature to probe 
CHAPTER 2 I SEAGROW CAVES
·�r--f SEAGROW (AVES
MAP 3: 5EAGROW CAVES
invasively into another creature's mind. But it tran­
scends language barriers, and you can play around 
with the kind of communication that the spores al­
low. Myconids' facial expressions might be difficult 
to read, but their telepathic communication might 
carry a direct expression of the myconids' emotional 
state. For example, when the myconids talk about 
their ailing leader, the characters might feel a deep 
sadness and a sense of anxiety much more clearly 
and powerfully than mere words and facial expres­
sions can communicate. 
The effect of Rapport Spores lasts for 1 hour, so 
characters might be telepathically linked to each 
other whenever they're within 30 feet of each other 
even after they leave the cave. Encourage the play­
ers to think about how this might affect their charac­
ters. Does it make them feel closer to their friends? 
Does it ease any suspicions they might have had 
about each other? 
DISTRE SS SPORES 
When myconids take damage, they release spores 
that alert all other myconids within 240 feet of 
them. All myconids in the cave are in range of each 
other's Distress Spores. Myconids in areas B2 and 
B3 move to area B4 if they detect Distress Spores. 
CHAPTER 2 I SEA GROW CAVESSEA GROW CAVES LOCA TIONS 
The following locations are keyed to map 3, which 
shows the layout of the Seagrow Caves. 
Bl: ENT RANCE TUNNEL 
Multicolored fungus covers the walls of this tunnel, its 
bioluminescent glow filling the cavern with dim lig ht. 
The surface of the water swirls with colorful, faintly 
glowing spores-perhaps reacting to the movement 
of something under the surface. 
At high tide, the tunnel is flooded, so visitors must 
approach by boat or swim. At low tide, walkways 
formed by the tops of stone columns line the sides 
of the tunnel, leading to a flight of natural steps up 
to area B2. A spore servant octopus lurks in the 
water and attacks any creatures (other than myco­
nids) who enter the tunnel, regardless of the state 
of the tides. Before the myconid leader lapsed into 
unconsciousness, it created this guardian to keep 
outsiders away. 
As described on the previous page, the water level 
here varies by up to 10 feet with the tides. At high 
tide, the water is about 8 feet deep along the edges 
of the tunnel and 25 feet deep in the middle. At low 
tide, the walkways along the edges are exposed, and 
the water is 15 feet deep in the middle. 
2nd-Level Characters. If the characters are 2nd 
level, two stirges clinging to the tunnel ceiling are 
disturbed if fighting breaks out in this area and join 
the battle. The stirges ignore the spore servant. 
\ 
B2: FUNGUS FARM 
This fifty-foot- high cavern is a forest of multicolored 
fungi, ranging from tiny filaments to tree-sized mush· 
rooms. A natural staircase of stone columns along 
the east wall leads up ten feet to a higher cave area in 
the north. Water burbles down from that upper cave 
and collects in a large pool. Two small mushroom-like 
people are working ami d the mushrooms near the 
pond. A sickening smell, like sulfur, hangs in the air. 
The waterfall is fed from a pool in the upper cave, 
which in turn is supplied by runoff trickling down 
from the surface. Both pools are 5 feet deep at most. 
The two mushroom people are myconid sprouts 
named Molen and Kraz. They are spreading fer· 
tilizer from area B3, while two myconid adults 
named Hipsiz and Rugoso tend the mushrooms 
near the upper pool, out of sight from below. All 
four myconids are oblivious to the true threat in the 
cave-three violet fungi that grow among the harm· 
less mushrooms here. 
If the characters move into the cave toward the 
myconids, one violet fungus attacks them, extending 
long tendrils that cause immediate rot when they 
touch living flesh. Read this text: 
As you advance into the cave, a sickly looking mush· 
room suddenly stirs to life. It extends long purple 
tendrils toward you and moves slowly across the cave 
floor on root-like tendrils. 
Running the Comb at. Because the violet fungi 
move so slowly, it's easy for the characters to stay 
out of their reach and kill the fungus monsters 
with ranged attacks. The interesting part of this en­
counter is identifying the danger. One violet fungus 
moves and attacks to start the encounter, but the 
other two remain motionless until characters move 
close to them. 
You don't need to keep track of exactly where ev­
eryone is standing in the room. Instead, rely on your 
sense of what's fun and exciting. When a character moves away from an active violet fungus, have an­
other fungus stir and attack that character on the 
fungus's next turn. If a character scans the fungus 
farm looking for more violet fungi, cast as much 
doubt as you can: many of the fungi look sickly and 
purple but pose no danger. 
My conids. The myconid sprouts avoid the char­
acters and the violet fungi. If the adults become 
aware of danger through the noise of combat (or the 
sprouts' Distress Spores), they move as quickly as 
they can to protect the sprouts. 
If the characters defeat the violet fungi, the my­
conids' attitude improves to indifferent, and they 
are willing to speak to the characters (using their 
Rapport Spores). The adults agree to accompan y 
the characters and vouch for them with the rest of 
the myconid colony, improving the other myconids' 
attitude to indifferent as well. 
Blighted Fungi. A character who examines any of 
the fungi notices that many of the mushrooms are 
sickly, shriveled, and blotched with black patches of 
decay. The blight has no obvious source. 
Treasure. The fungus farm contains heart cap 
mushrooms ready for harvest. A character who 
spends 15 minutes searching this chamber for use­
ful fungi and succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence (Na­
ture) or Wisdom (Survival) check finds ld6 of these 
reddish mushrooms, which bear an unsettling re­
semblance to human hearts. Tarak can make each 
heart cap mushroom into a potion of healing. 
2nd-Level Characters. If the characters are 2nd 
level, add two violet fungi to this encounter. 
B3: LARDER 
This cave reeks of rot, and the floor is covered with 
decaying vegetati on. Three small mushroom-folk are 
working amid the filth. In the southwest corner of the 
cave, a bulbous object the size of a cart clings to the 
wall and ceiling, glistening like a glob of jel ly. 
Three myconid sprouts named Bispo, Valup, and 
Popple work here gathering fertilizer for use in 
area B2. The bulbous object is a stirge nest, which 
characters can identif y with a successful DC 15 In­
telligence (Nature) check. If a character moves more 
than 5 feet into the chamber, six stirges emerge 
from the nest and attack. Meanwhile, the sprouts 
flee toward area B4 at the first sign of intruders, re­
lying on the distraction of the stirges to escape. 
2nd-Level Characters. If the characters are 2nd 
level, add two stirges to this encounter. 
CHAP TER 2 I SEA GROW CAVES
B4: CIRCLE CHAMBER 
Six clusters of giant mushrooms are arranged in a 
rough circle around this cavern. Several human-sized 
mushroom folk stand in a circle in the center of the 
cave. The smell of sulfur is stronger here. 
Six myconid adults are here. Two of them (named 
Agric and Omphalo ) are tending to the other four 
(Craterel, Pleuro, Subrufus, and Virosa), who are 
standing stock -still in a dream-like trance called a 
meld, experiencing a shared transcendent state. The 
two conscious myconids move quickly to confront 
any intruders who aren't escorted by other myco­
nids, and they respond with violence to any threat. 
All six myconids are ill and fatigued from the 
blight that is spreading through the caves, so they 
take turns resting here. 
B5: SINE NSA's SANCTUM 
Glowing fungus and colorful crystals grow from the 
walls and ceilings of this smaller cave. In the middle 
of the cave, two human-sized mushroom folk tend to
a larger specimen of their kind. The large one is shriv­
eled and covered with unhealthy purple blotches, and 
it does not move. 
Two myconid adults named Auranta and Enok are 
tending the unconscious myconid who leads this 
colony, Sinen sa. The adults collect spores from a 
barrel-sized, glowing red fungus that vaguely resem­
bles a human brain and puff the spores around the 
leader's head. The treatment is keeping the leader 
alive for now, but it is a losing battle. Sinensa's only 
hope is for the blight to end. The adults zealously 
defend their leader, immediately attacking intruders 
who aren't accompanied by other myconids. 
Treasure. If the characters bring the glowing red 
fungus, called a ruby morel, back to the cloister, 
Tarak uses it to make them an elixir of healt h (de­
scribed in appendix A). 
CHAPTER '2 I SEAGR OW CAVESB6: CRYSTA L CAV E 
The air in this cave is choked with thick smoke that as­
saults your nostrils with a pungent odor of brimstone. 
Strange, flickering orange light illuminates the smoke. 
This area is free of fungal growth; instead, crystals 
grow from the rock. To your right, a large cluster of 
purple crystals juts from the stone. On the far wall, 
a glowing orange crystal wedged into a fissure in the 
cave wall seems to be the source of the light. Streaks 
of soot trace a path along the cave walls between the 
purple crystals and the fissure. 
Two fume drakes lurk amid the sulfurous fumes. 
These elemental creatures look like little dragons 
formed entirely of greenish smoke. They don't leave 
this cave, but they rush to attack any creature that 
enters it. 
This cave is the source of the blight spreading 
through the myconid colony. As the characters 
explore the cave, they can easily determine that 
noxious fumes from deep beneath the island seep 
up around the vein of purple crystals. Ordinarily, 
the fumes vent to the surface through a fissure in 
the west wall, but the fissure is now blocked by the 
enormous orange crystal, which is also the source 
of the light here. 
The heart of the problem is the tomb of the red 
dragon Sharruth, deep beneath the island. The pres­
ence of such a powerful dragon far underground 
causes the volcanic activity that produces the nox­
ious fumes. What's more, the dragon's energy occa­
sionally tears open small rifts in the fabric of reality 
that lead to the Elemental Plane of Fire-another di­
mension of reality that is the cosmic source of fiery 
energy. The Plane of Fire is the origin of both the 
orange crystal blocking the vent (which is actually 
an egg case) and the creatures currently in the cave. 
Fire Crystal. Destroying the orange crystal block­
ing the western fissure allows the noxious fumes to 
escape the cave and stops the blight that is harming 
the myconids. A single strong whack with a weapon, 
a crowbar, or another tool is sufficient to shatter 
it. When the crystal breaks, a two-foot-diameter 
sphere of smoldering obsidian falls to the floor amid 
the other pieces and breaks open, releasing a fire 
snake from this stony egg. Seeing the characters 
only as fuel, it attacks them at once. 
Breaking the fire crystal also reveals the reason 
the myconids avoid this cave: the cave is imme­
diately filled with shimmering sunlight refractea 
through the crystals that line the vent. Bright light 
fills the entire area. 
Treasure. The fire snake's egg breaks into 25 tiny 
chunks of obsidian worth 10 gp each. 
2nd-Level Characters. If the characters are 2nd 
level, add a third fume drake to the room when the 
characters first arrive. Then, at the same time the 
fire snake hatches from its egg, two more fume 
drakes emerge from the cluster of purple crystals. 
END ING TH IS CH APTER 
If the characters destroy the orange crystal so the 
toxic fumes can escape the caves, the myconids' 
attitude improves to friendly. Sinensa, the myconid 
leader, regains consciousness the following morn­
ing. If the characters are present when Sinensa 
awakens, Sinensa gives them the ruby morel from 
area BS and permission to keep any other treasure 
or mushrooms they collected in the caves. 
Once the characters return to Dragon's Rest, 
Tarak can use the ruby morel to make an elixir of 
health (described in appendix A), which he gives to 
the characters in gratitude for their efforts. GA IN A LEVEL 
After they complete this chapter of the adventure, 
the characters gain a level. If they visited Seagrow 
Caves before the wreck of Compass Rose, they ad­
vance from 1st level to 2nd level. The residents of 
Dragon's Rest urge them to visit the wreck of Com­
pass Rose next (see "Shipwreck" on page 12). 
If they've already explored the wreck of Compass 
Rose in chapter 3, they advance from 2nd level to 
3rd level and are ready to visit Clifftop Observatory 
in chapter 4. See "Lost Wyrmling" on page 13. 
The character sheets explain what happens when 
characters gain a level.

CURSED SHIPWR ECK 
THIS CHAPT ER ASS UM ES THE CHARAC TERS COME

also includes instructions to scale up the danger in 
combat encounters if the characters complete chap­

now 2nd level. 
SHIP WRE CK OVER VIE W 
Ever since the violent death of a gold dragon on the 
rocky shoal on the north side of Stormwreck Isle, 
the bone-str ewn rocks have been the site of many 
shipwrecks through the centuries. One such ship­
wreck left a lasting mark on the island. 
About forty years ago, a ship named Compass 
Rose carrying passengers bound for the cloister 
wrecked on the shoal, killing all aboard. To the hor­
ror of the cloister's residents, those who drowned 
found their way ashore as shambling zombies. 
Since the loss of that ship, each new shipwreck 
has brought a fresh wave of zombie sailors to the 
island's shore. Fortunately, wrecks are rare-or they 
were, until recently. 
Not long ago, a harpy settled into the wreck of 
Compass Rose. With its magically entrancing voice, 
CHAPTER 3 I CURSED SHIP WRECK the harpy has been luring ships to crash on the 
shoal and feasting on the unlucky sailors. The sail­
ors who escape the harpy's talons end up as zom­
bies menacing the people of Dragon's Rest. 
The harpy is only the most immediate problem 
lurking in the wrecked hull of Compass Rose. The 
greater threat is a cursed talisman held in the ship's 
OTHER SHIP WRECKS 
This chapter assumes the characters heed Runara's 
advice and search Compass Rose for clues to the recent 
shipwrecks. If the characters decide to explore other 
recent wrecks, you can use the map of Compass Rose 
to represent any other sunken ship's deck plan, though 
most of the wrecks are entirely underwater. Characters 
exploring other wrecks might find more zombies­
sailors killed in the wrecks who were animated by the 
talisman in Compass Rose's hold but couldn't get off 
their ships for some reason. They might also find giant 
octopuses (you can use the spore servant octopus 
stat block from appendix B), ghouls, or other da ngers 
aboard. These adventures are yours to create, but only 
the wreck of Compass Rose holds the secret to freeing 
Dragon's Rest from the zombie attacks. 
hold, imbued with magic by a long-dead sailor's 
desperate prayers to a demon lord. This curse is re­
sponsible for the drowned sailors animating as zom­
bies. Most of the sailors who were aboard the ship 
when it wrecked are long gone, but some zombies 
have been trapped in the wreck for years. 
SHIP WRE CK FEA TURES 
The wreck of Compass Rose is located at the north­
ern end of a long spur of sharp rocks and dragon 
bones jutting from the ocean waves, about 21/2 miles 
from the cloister. It remains mostly above the water, 
held up by the ancient bones that tore its hull. The 
wreck has the following features: 
Walls. The soggy wooden walls are aged to a sickly 
black and green. Algae and barnacles grow on 
walls throughout the wreck. 
Ceilings. The ceilings in the ship are 8 feet high. 
Doors. The doorways are 6 feet high, and the 
doors are in the same waterlogged condition as 
the walls. 
Light. During the day, the sun fills the upper deck 
and main deck with bright light and the lower 
deck with dim light. Sunlight doesn't reach into 
the hold, and the whole wreck is dark at night. See 
"Vision" in the rulebook. 
RU NNING TH IS CH APTER 
Dragon's Rest has a rowboat the characters can 
take to visit the wreck of Compass Rose. The trip of 
21/2 miles takes about 1 hour and 40 minutes to row. 
When the characters arrive, read this text: 
Waves lap against a derelict ship lodged against a 
ridge of rocks and enormous dragon bones. A faint 
odor of rot wafts on the sea air, along with the sound 
of screeching seagulls and the roar of the surf. A tan­
gled mess of tattered sails and rigging hangs off the 
starboar d side of the main deck, offering one poss ible 
way to climb aboard. At the stern, you can make out a 
gaping hole in the hull beneath the water line. 
If the characters pull the rowboat up to the south 
(starboard) side of the ship, they can easily tie up 
the little boat to the derelict's rigging and climb onto 
the main deck (area Cl). However, they're free to ex­
plore other possibilities for getting aboard, such as 
swimming through the hole in the hold (area C9). SHIP WRE CK LOCA TIONS 
The following locations are keyed to map 4, which 
shows the layout of the shipwreck. 
Cl: MAIN DEC K 
The moldering wood of the deck is slick with algae 
and seawater. Amid the tangle of rigging, splintered 
railings, and stray seaweed, you spot boots, bones, 
and bits of gore that seem considerably more recent 
than the wreck of this ship. 
Stairs lead to upper decks at fore and aft, and doors 
lead into cabins under those decks. The mainma st 
remains intact and mostly upright, topped with a 
crow's nest overflo wing with debris. A staircase near 
the mast and a large hatch on the port side both lead 
down into the hold. 
Crow' s Nest. A rope ladder runs up the mast to 
the crow's nest, secure despite the condition of the 
wreck. The mast sways alarming ly as characters 
climb, and at the top of the 50-foot climb the charac­
ters find that they are leaning out over the water on 
the port (north) side of the ship. 
The crow's nest now serves as a nest for the harpy 
that has made Compass Rose its lair. The bas­
ket-shaped area is stuffed with wood shavings, dry 
grass, and shredded canvas from ships' sails. Bits of 
bones, tufts of hair, and shiny baubles are also visi­
ble in the harpy's nest. 
Ha rpy' s Return. When the characters arrive at 
the shipwreck, the harpy is out looking for another 
ship to lure onto the rocks. It returns after the char­
acters have spent some time aboard, as described in 
"Harpy's Return" later in this chapter. 
Treasure. Characters who search through the 
crow's nest find a small gold bracelet worth 25 gp, a 
single gold hoop earring worth 25 gp, two small ti­
ger eye gems worth 10 gp each, and one bloodstone 
gem worth 50 gp. 
C2 : FORECASTLE 
The broken foremast leans out across a broken railing, 
with a tangle of rigging and tattered canvas trailing 
down to the rocks and dragon bones below. A rusted 
and rotting ballista stands near the broken mast. 
The ballista no longer works. There's nothing of in­
terest to find here. 
CHAP TER 3 I CURSED SHIPWRECK 
C3 : QU ARTERDEC K 
I The splintered remains of a mast jut up from this rear deck like a broken spear. The ship's wheel is askew, 
dislodg ed from its mechanism. 
The wheel bears the name of the ship- Compass 
Rose-engraved and inlaid with mother-of -pearl, 
though in the wheel's current position the name 
is upside down. If a character turns the wheel, it 
snaps free of its axle and falls. If the character tries 
to catch the wheel before it hits the deck, ask the 
player to make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. On 
a successful save, the character catches the wheel. 
On a failed save, the wheel hits the deck with a loud 
thud that catches the attention of the zombies in 
area C4. A moment later, the thud is answered by 
a loud crash against the door to C4, which repeats 
every 10 to 15 seconds. 
C4 : CAPT AIN' S QUA RTERS 
The door to the captain's quarters is barricaded 
from the inside, though the heavy wooden bar block­
ing the door is half rotten. A character who tries to 
force the door open can break it down with a suc­
cessful DC 10 Strength check. 
The door crashes open to reveal two drowned sailors 
in a cabin that must once have been luxurious. A 
bookcase, half collapsed, holds waterlogged and dis­
integrating books and scrolls. The polished wood desk 
leans awkwa rdly on three legs; it has an ornate com­
pass set in its center. The bed is covered in rotting 
bedding and sags in the middle . A jagged hole gapes 
in the floor beside the bed. 
If the characters dropped the wheel in area C3 or 
needed more than one Strength check to open the 
door into this room, the two zombies are beside the 
door when it opens. Otherwise, they're aimlessly 
shuffling around the cabin. In either case, they move 
to attack the characters right away. 
Ho le to the Ho ld. The hole beside the captain's 
bed formed when the rotting floorboards collapsed 
under the weight of the captain's sea chest. It broke 
through the floor of the lower deck (area C8) as well, 
coming to rest in the hold (area C9). 
Treasure. Two small drawers in the desk hold 
a pouch containing 50 gp, a set of cartographer's 
tools, and a dagger. The compass set in the desktop 
can easily be pried free; it is worth 25 gp. 
2nd-Level Characters. If the characters are 2nd 
level, add a third zombie to this encounter. 
CHAPTER 3 I CURSED SHIP WRECK C5: GALLEY 
A long-dead , headless skeleton sits propped up 
against a counter to the right, but the gal ley is other­
wise empty. Unless ... did the skeleton just move? 
Small, harmless -crabs are crawling over the skele­
tal remains, causing the illusion of movement. 
C6 : CREW QUA RTERS 
Six double bunks line the edges of this cabin. Per­
sonal effects are strewn about the room, and a faded, 
painted portrait hangs on one wall. 
The portrait shows a young couple smiling and 
embracing. Written across the bottom of the por­
trait are the words "Aleitha and Brastos-together 
forever." The black-haired woman wears a sailor's 
uniform similar to the tatters worn by the zombies 
aboard this ship. The blond-haired man wears a 
merchant's fine clothes. 
Flo orboard Stash. A character who searches the 
cabin and succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Percep­
tion) check notices a floorboard in the middle of the 
room that is raised slightly above its neighbors. A 
character who lifts the floorboard triggers a trap: 
a tiny dart shoots up, making an attack against the 
character. Its attack bonus is +5. If it hits, it deals 2 
(ld4) piercing damage, and the character must suc­
ceed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or take 
3 (ld6) poison damage. Once the trap is triggered, 
it does not trigger again unless a character resets 
it. (If the characters figure out a way to lift the floor­
board from a safe distance, the dart misses.) 
Treasure. A sack full of 200 gp rests in a small 
compartment beneath the raised floorboard. 
C7: MESS HALL 
A long table takes up most of this cabi n, which must 
have served as a mess hall. Decaying chairs are 
scattered about, and broken glass and crockery litter 
the floor. 
There's nothing of interest to find here. 
THE WRECK OF COMPASS ROSE 
UPPER DECK 
LOWER DECK -= 
MAP 4: THE WRECK OF CoMP Ass Rose 
C8: LOWER DECK 
The descent to the lower deck is chilly, wet, and unset­
tling. Seawater obscures the floor and sloshes agai nst 
the hull. Decaying crates and barrels are scattered 
around, some floating freely and others stacked into 
corners. You hear splashing as a walking corpse lum­
bers toward you, wading in water that doesn't quite 
reach its knees. 
The zombie is an obvious threat, but another Un­
dead monster-a ghoul-lurks in the aft part of the 
hold. Much more cunning than the zombies, the 
ghoul waits to attack until the characters are busy 
with the zombie. It hopes to paralyze a character 
with its Claw attack, then drag the paralyzed charac­
ter away to feast on while the other characters con­
tend with the zombie. Unlike the zombies, the ghoul 
is not a former member of the ship's crew, but a vile 
scavenger drawn by the presence of decaying flesh. 
The water on the floor ranges from about 6 inches 
deep on the starboard (south) side of the ship to 
18 inches deep on the port (north) side. The water 
makes the entire lower deck difficult terrain (see 
"Difficult Terrain" in the rulebook). MAllt DECK 
... ..,:. 
Ho le to the Ho ld. A hole in the ceiling in the 
northwest part of the area leads up to the captain's 
quarters (area C4). It's matched by a similar hole 
directly below it. The holes were caused by the cap­
tain's chest falling through the floorboards all the 
way to the hold, where it came to rest (see area C9). 
2nd-Level Characters. If the characters are 2nd 
level, add two zombies to this encounter. 
Treasure. Some of the goods in the crates here 
remain valuable_ Using a crowbar, a character can 
pry open a crate in 1 minute; without a crowbar, it 
takes 10 minutes. When a character opens a crate, 
roll a d6 and consult the Crate Contents table to de­
termine what's inside. The characters can find each 
item on the table once. 
CRA TE CONTE NTS

Five bottles of fine wine (worth 10 gp each) packed 
in straw, plus one broken bottle

CHAPTER 3 I CURSED SHIP WRECK 
C9: HOLD
As the cold water engulfs you, a strange undersea 
world is revealed. Colorful seaweed grows over the 
shattered hull, especia lly around the gaping hole in 
the stern of the ship. Tiny fish dart among hunks of 
debris and cargo. 
See "Climbing, Swimming, and Crawling" and 
"Suffocating" in the "The Environment" section 
of the rulebook as the characters venture into the 
submerged hold. Fortunately for them, unless some­
thing goes wrong, there's no significant time pres­
sure on the characters as they swim around here. 
They can surface (at the hole in area C8's floor, or at 
the top of the stairs up to C8) to breathe as often as 
they need to. 
Captain' s Chest. A heavy iron chest lies on the 
floor of the hold, directly beneath the hole it fell 
through. If a character opens the chest here, a large 
air bubble rushes out, and a packet, wrapped and 
sealed in waxed fabric, rises up after it. Though the 
chest is heavy (about 125 pounds), the characters 
can also carry it to the surface before opening it. 
The chest contains a pouch holding 55 gp and 
three turquoise stones (worth 10 gp each), as well 
as a pair of boots of elvenk ind. The floating packet 
contains the captain's journal, which has been keep 
safe from the water by its wrapping. A braid of hair 
is stuck in the pages like a bookmark, indicating the 
log's last entry. The last entry reads as follows: 
CHAPTER 3 I CUR SED SHIPWRECK 19 Tarsakh 
Our journey is ended, though I fear my own is to 
continue in the most horrible way imaginable . Com­
pass Rose wrecked on a shoal south of Neverwinter. 
Many sailors perished with the initial impact, and 
Aleitha was gravely injured. As I tended her wounds, 
she clutched her talisman and breathed soft prayers. 
I asked her what the talisman signified. She told me 
love. Her husband waits for her at Dragon's Rest, hav­
ing pledged his service to the dragon there. The talis­
man is made from locks of their hair, woven together 
as a promise to be reunited no matter what fate might 
befall them. It might have been a beautif ul story, 
had it not been for Aleitha's gruesome end-and the 
words of the prayer I heard as she breathed her last. 
For she was begging Orcus, the Prince of Undeath, to 
reunite her with her husband. 
I held her hands as the breath left her, and I felt a 
horrible chill pass through her. Next I knew, she was 
sinking her teeth into my neck. At the same momen t, 
I heard moans begin to rise from the dead sailors all 
around us. What curse has she brought on us all? 
Already I feel a creeping chill overtaking my body. I 
am securing her talisman with this book in my chest, 
in the hope that someone who comes after us may 
end this nightmar e by bringing Altheia's talisman to 
her husband. 
The talisman is formed from long locks of hair­
some blonde, some black-braided together and 
knotted around two small finger bones. If a charac­
ter casts detect magic , the talisman is revealed to 
carry magic of the school of necroma ncy. See "End­
ing This Chapter" for more about the talisman. 
Tarsakh is a month in the calendar of the Forgot­
ten Realms, roughly corresponding to April. No year 
is specified in the log. 
About Orcus. Known as the Demon Prince of Un­
death and the Blood Lord, the demon lord Orcus is 
a fiend whose power rivals that of the gods. Ruling 
over hordes of demons in the nightmarish plane of 
existence called the Abyss, Orcus yearns to trans­
form the multiverse into a ghastly place of death. 
Many Undead creatures (like ghouls) worship him 
or seek to bargain with him in exchange for some 
fragment of his power over undeath. 
A New Threat. After the characters find the cap­
tain's chest, when they come up from the hold to the 
lower deck, they hear a heavy thump on the deck 
above them as the harpy lands on the main deck. 
See "Harpy's Return" below. 
HARPY'S RETURN 
The harpy that makes its lair in the crow's nest 
(area Cl) returns to the ship when one of these con­
ditions is met: 
• The characters find the captain's chest in the hold 
(area C9) and return to the lower deck (area CS). 
• The characters finish a short or long rest 
on the ship. 
The next time the characters show themselves on 
the main deck, the harpy confronts them: 
A terrifying mons ter perches on the top of the crow's 
nest, spreading its scraggly wings and screeching 
harshly. Its wings and legs resemble those of a mangy 
vulture, while its head, torso, and arms look almost 
human. It clutches a large bone like a club and flexes 
its talons. 
On its first turn, the harpy uses its Luring Song in 
an attempt to charm the characters and draw them 
up to the crow's nest. A character charmed by the 
harpy's Luring Song thinks it's the most beautiful 
sound they have ever heard. It's easy to imagine how 
a ship might be lured off course to get closer to the 
source of this music. 
TALKI NG TO THE HARPY 
The harpy is cruel and hungry for flesh, but it 
speaks Common and can be reasoned with. It's not 
easy to convince the bloodthi rsty monster to change 
its ways and leave the wreck of Compass Rose, but 
if the players come up with a strong argument (pos­
sibly supported with high rolls on Charisma checks), 
the harpy cooperates. These tactics are the most 
likely to convince the harpy to leave: 
• If the characters have already reduced the harpy 
to fewer than half its hit points, it might flee. 
• If the characters claimed the treasure from the 
crow's nest while the harpy was absent, it might 
agree to leave in exchange for the return of 
its treasure. 
• If the characters are 2nd level and two harpies are 
present (see below), characters can play on the 
distrust between the two harpies and might con­
vince them to part ways and leave the area. 
2ND -LEVEL CHAR ACTE RS 
If the characters are 2nd level, add a second harpy 
to the encounter. This harpy initially perches on 
the ballista in area C2 and uses its own Luring 
Song. Although they're allies, the harpies don't trust 
each other. ENDIN G TH IS CH APTER 
If the characters defeat the harpy, one problem is 
solved: no more ships will be lured to the rocks, and 
shipwrecks will once again be a rarity. 
If the characters find Aleitha's talisman in the 
hold, they can solve the zombie problem entirely. If 
they bring the talisman to Runara and explain what 
they found in the captain's log, Runara nods sadly. 
She remembers Aleitha's husband, Brastos, but 
he died many years ago. He was laid to rest in the 
graveyard atop the cliffs at the northern point of the 
island, northwest of Dragon's Rest. 
The graves in the little clifftop cemetery are cov­
ered in white wildflowers and marked with simple 
wooden slabs. If the characters lay the talisman on 
Brastos's grave, bury it in the soil over the grave, 
or burn it atop the grave, the wind seems to sigh in 
relief. Thick fog forms around the rocks north of the 
island. The fog lingers overnight, and when it dis­
perses, no trace of Compass Rose remains. 
The characters might also disregard the words of 
the captain's journal and destroy the talisman while 
aboard the ship. This also breaks the curse-the 
characters still feel something like a sigh in the air, 
fog rises up to engulf the wreck while the characters 
are rowing away, and the ship is gone when the fog 
lifts the next day. 
If the characters undo the talisman's curse, the 
next time they sleep, the cleric character has an­
other dream. Read this text to the cleric's player: 
In your dream, you are once again on the deck of the 
ship that brought you here, and you see Stormwreck 
Isle shrouded in darkness, just as it was in your earlier 
dreams. As you sail closer, the darkness breaks, and a 
dazzling ray of sunlight shines down over the island. A 
gentle plume of white smoke rises up from the island 
as the darkne ss is driven away. Then the darkness and 
the smoke are gone, the light swells to enfold you as 
well, and you feel the love and approval of your god. 
GA IN A LEVEL 
After they complete this chapter of the adventure, 
the characters gain a level. If they visited Compass 
Rose before Seagrow Caves, they advance to 2nd 
level. The residents of Dragon's Rest urge them to 
visit Seagrow Caves next (see "Sea Caves" on page 
12). If the characters have already explored the 
caves, they advance to 3rd level and are ready to 
visit Clifftop Observatory in chapter 4. See "Lost 
Wyrmling" on page 13. 
The character sheets explain what happens when 
characters gain a level. 
CHAPTER 3 I CURSED SHIP WRECK 
CH AP TER 4 
CLIFFTOP OBSER VATORY 
Turs CHAPTER ASS UMES THE CHARACTERS VISIT 
the observatory after exploring Seagrow Caves 
and the wreck of Compass Rose, and thus have 
reached 3rd level. If they come here before visiting 
the other adventure sites, the combat encounters 
are probably too difficult for them. That's the reason 
Runara won't give the characters the moonstone 
key or information about the observatory until after 
they've dealt with the island's other problems. If 
necessar y, you can have Runara warn the charac­
ters that they're not ready to face this part of the 
adventure yet. 
OBSER VAT ORY OVE RVIEW 
During its heyday, the Clifftop Observatory was a 
marvel of magical innovation. Adorned with gor­
geous stained glass windows and marble spires, the 
observatory's towers stood high above the churn­
ing sea on separate islets, linked by shimmering 
bridges of magical energy. But the observatory was 
wrecked when Runara battled her blue dragon rival 
centuries ago, and now it lies in ruin, a crumbled 
memory overtaken by nature. In recent months, the observatory ruins have 
become the home of an arrogant blue dragon wyrm­
ling called Sparkrender, a descendant of Runara's 
ancient rival. Like his ancestor, Sparkrender seeks 
to claim the destructive magic that lingers at the 
site. Like Runara, Sparkrender has recruited ko­
bolds to join his cause. 
About five days before the characters arrived on 
the island, a bronze dragon wyrmling named Aidron 
left the safety of Dragon's Rest and Runara's tute­
lage and came to the ancient observatory. The two 
wyrmlings met and immedia tely clashed. Sparkren­
der attempted to turn the bronze wyrmling against 
Runara, but Aidron's hatred of chromatic dragons 
was stronger than his disagreement with Runara. 
Ultimately, Sparkrender overpowered Aidron and 
imprisoned him in the observatory ruins,. 
Sparkrender believes Aidron is the key to un­
locking the observatory's magic and claiming 
his ancestor's power. With the bronze wyrmling 
imprisoned, Sparkrender began planning a ritual 
that will awaken the spirits of all the island's dead 
dragons and bind them to his will-at the cost of 
Aidron's life. 
OBS ERVAT ORY FEA TURES 
The observatory is built on a series of basalt spires 
jutting up from the ocean at the southeastern tip of 
Stormwreck Isle. Almost all the structure's former 
ceilings and walls have crumbled away, exposing 
the ruins to the open air. 
Unless otherwise noted, the ruins stand 30 feet 
above the ocean's surface. The rugged cliffs offer 
abundant hand-and footholds, so a character who 
jumps or falls into the water and survives (see "Fall­
ing" in the rulebook) can climb back up without 
needing to make an ability check. 
RU NNING TH IS CH APTER 
Once the characters decide to visit the Clifftop 
Observatory, they have three options for reach­
ing the site: 
By Boat. Dragon's Rest has a rowboat the charac­
ters can take around the eastern end of the island. 
The trip to the observatory is 5 miles, which takes 
about 3 hours and 20 minutes to row. 
Along the Coast. Walking around the coast of 
the island is a little easier than rowing, and a 
quicker trip despite the characters having to walk 
around the eastern bay instead of rowing across 
it. The 6-mile trip takes only 2 hours at a normal 
walking pace. 
Overland. The characters can walk southeast from 
Dragon's Rest to the head of the bay, where a 
rough path cuts across the island to the eastern 
bay. The rocky ground of the island is difficult 
terrain, but this is still the fastest and most direct 
route. Characters can make the 3V2-mile trip in 
about 1 hour and 15 minutes. 
APPROAC HIN G BY LAND 
If the characters approach the observatory by land, 
read the following text: 
Clambering over the rocky ground of Stormwreck 
Isle, you spot strange, twisted protrusions of glassy 
crystal jutting from the earth. The vegetation in this 
area bears reddish branching scars tha t form similar 
shapes. Suddenl y, you hear a screeching roar and 
notice a winged, glittering blue shape swooping 
overhead. 
The blue shape is Sparkrender flying by. This 
glimpse of the dragon is an opportunity to make 
your players nervous about the foe they're about 
to face. Feel free to elaborate on the description 
of Sparkrender and play on the characters' worry 
that he might spot them, but ultimately he passes 
by without noticing them. The characters see him come to rest on a rocky spire off the coast as he re­
turns to his hoard among the ruins (area D5). 
A character who examines the crystalline pro­
trusions or the scarred vegetation can make a DC 
10 Intelligence (Nature) check. On a success, the 
character recognizes the phenomenon as a sign of 
lightning strikes-or the lightning breath of a blue 
or bronze dragon. 
Assuming the characters continue toward the 
observatory, they soon arrive at area Dl, de­
scribed below. 
APPR OAC HING BY WAT ER 
If the characters row to the observatory, read this 
text instead: 
As you round the southeastern tip of the island, you 
can see crumbling ruins atop basalt columns just off 
the main island body. If you pull the boat ashore on 
the island, it would be an easy walk up to the top of 
the cliffs, though there is no obvious bridge from the 
cliffs to the ruins. Alternatively, you could tie the boat 
up at the bottom of the columns and try to climb di­
rectly up to the ruins. 
As you consider these options, you hear a screech­
ing roar and notice a winged, glittering blue shape 
swooping through the air ahead of you. The figure 
comes to rest atop the column farthest from Storm­
wreck Isle and vanishes from sight. 
Again, Sparkrender does not notice the characters 
as he returns to his lair, but feel free to tease the 
players with the idea that he migh t notice them. 
If the characters beach the boat on the shore, they 
can easily climb the bluffs to area Dl, described 
below. If they tie up the boat at the base of one of 
the pillars, they can instead climb to the area atop it 
(area D2, D3, D4, or D5). 
SPARKREND ER'S KO BOLD AL LIES 
The kobolds who joined forces with Sparkrender 
are lawful evil and cruel. Their initial reaction to­
ward outsiders is hostile (see "Social Interaction" in 
the rulebook ), but they're more likely to warn intrud­
ers to leave the ruins than to immedia tely attack. 
They readily threaten violence and back up their 
threats with combat if necessar y. 
As an action, a character can try to convince a 
hostile kobold to have a conversation or to allow the 
characters to explore the area, doing so on a suc­
cessful DC 15 Charisma check. Depending on the 
character's approach, the Deception, Intimidation, 
or Persuasion skill can apply to the check.

MAP 5: CLtFFTOP OBSER VATORY 
This list summarizes what the kobolds know: 
Kobold History . The kobolds here have served 
Sparkrender for about a year. They revere the blue 
dragon as a semidivine figure and trust him to 
provide for their every need. 
Big Plans. Sparkrender has big plans that will al­
low him to manifest his full power. The wyrmling 
is waiting for the sculpture in the rotunda ruins 
(area D2) to tell him it's time to act The kobolds 
think it must be soon-possibly even today. 
Dragon Vis itor. Not long ago, another dragon ar­
rived. This other dragon was about Sparkrender's 
size but looked like greenish-yellow metal. They 
remember hearing the two arguing at the obser­
vatory tower (area DS), and they have heard the 
other dragon roaring and crashing around inside 
the tower (area D6) since then. 
Caved-In Wall. Though the kobolds have been try-
. ing to tidy the ruins, Sparkrender specifically told 
them not to clean up the newly caved-in wall at 
the base of the observatory tower (area D6). The 
caved-in wall is visible from area D3. 
CHA PTER 4 I CLIFFTOP OBSER VAT ORYTOWER lttIERIOR 
__ Ii 
OBS ERVATOR Y LOCA TIONS 
The following locations are keyed to map 5, which 
shows the layout of the Clifftop Observatory. 
Dl: OV ERLO OK 
A broken and overgrown path winds to the edge of the 
cliff. The overlook is marked by two marble statues 
veined with gold, each carved in the shape ofa dragon 
with its mouth open in a silent roar. 
At the base of each statue is a small hexagonal 
indentation, about 1 inch wide and 2 inches deep­
perfectly sized to accommoda te the moonstone key 
Runara gave them. 
When the key is inserted into the base of either 
statue, magical light sparks to life in both statues' 
open mouths, and a shimmering bridge made of 
iridescent magical energy extends from the over­
look to the observatory ruins (area D2). The bridge 
is sturdy and lasts until the key is removed from 
the statue. 
D2: ROTUNDA RUINS 
Broken stone lines this plaza-fragments of elegant 
statues, once-magnific ent pillars, and shining marble 
walls. At the center, a tall sculpture of rusted planets 
and gilded stars spins idly in a jerky mimicry of celes­
tial motion. 
A gargled screech suddenly rises from across the 
plaza. A half-dozen batlike creatures are swarming 
around two winged kobolds with blue paint smeared 
across their long snouts. The kobolds are fighting 
fiercely, but they seem close to being overwh elmed. 
The two winged kobolds are locked in battle with 
eight stirges. When the characters enter the area, 
six of the stirges turn their attention to this new, 
juicier prey. The kobolds try to deal with the remain­
ing two stirges, and then decide what to do based 
on what the characters are doing. If the characters 
actively help the kobolds during the battle, then the 
kobolds return the favor. If the characters attack the 
kobolds instead of (or as well as) the stirges, the ko­
bolds fight back. Otherwise, the kobolds hang back, 
trying to stay out of the way until the fight is over. 
Once the stirges have been defeated, if the ko­
bolds survive, they approach the characters. Their 
names are Mek and Minn, and they're the brothers 
of Myla, the kobold tinkerer at Dragon's Rest. They 
left their sister for dead after the stirge attack that 
maimed her wings. They have sworn loyalty to 
Sparkrender, and they share the dragon's cruel, 
haughty demeanor. 
If the characters act ively helped the kobolds or 
mention that Myla is alive, the kobolds' attitude 
becomes friendly. They offer to introduce the char­
acters to their leader and help the characters in any 
way they can (such as retrieving the moonstone 
key from area Dl so the characters can activate the 
bridge to D4). They won't help the characters fight 
Sparkrend er, though; they are loyal to the dragon. 
Golden Scu lptu re. The sculpture in the center of 
the rotunda is an astronomical model used for re­
search in centuries past. The sculpture depicts the 
planet of Tori! (the world of the Forgotten Realms), 
its moon (called Seh1ne), the sun, and seven other 
planets, as well as one comet with a very eccentric 
orbit. A character who studies the sculpture can 
puzzle out its importance with a successful DC 15 
Intelligence (Arcana) check: its current position sug­
gests the comet will soon pass very close to Toril. 
Sparkrender plans to hold his ritual when the 
comet is at its closest point. He believes the comet, 
called the King-Killer Star , controls the destiny of dragons and will allow him to claim the power of 
the dragons who fell on Stormwreck Isle. 
Dra gon Elli gies. The stirge attack interrupted the 
kobolds from their assigned task of preparing this 
site for Sparkrender's ritual. With the wyrmling's 
help, they have crudely sculpted five chunks of rub­
ble into vaguely draconic shapes and splashed each 
one with paint, and the kobolds were in the process 
of arranging them around the metal sculpture. 
Each effigy has the name of the dragon it represents 
etched into it. These are the names and colors of the 
five dragons: 
Name Color 
Astalagan Bronze 
Clyssavar Gold 
Eldenemir Blue 
Sharruth Red 
Turadaer Brass 
If the characters ask the kobolds about these dragon 
effigies, Mek and Minn swell with pride and explain 
that they crafted them according to Sparkrender's 
instructions. The kobolds know the effigies have 
some part to play in Sparkrender's plans. 
Energy Bridge Anchors. A pair of dragon statues 
like the ones in area Dl stands on the west side of 
the rotunda, and another pair stands on the south­
west side. If the moonstone key is inserted in one of 
these statues, the western pair creates a bridge back 
to the overlook (area Dl), and the southwestern pair 
creates a bridge to a crumbled and isolated tower 
(area D4). 
D3: KOBOLD CAMP 
A rickety bridge made of driftwood and rope spans 
the 15-foot gap between the rotunda (area D2) and 
this structure. 
Skittering sounds and whispers come from inside this 
ruined tower. Gaps in the stone are patched over with 
wooden planks and thr eadbar e cloth. 
Three kobolds (Ekrash, Erp, and Hev) and two 
winged kobolds (Nuhro and Snirke) currently in­
habit this camp, polishing sling bullets and keeping 
busy until it's time for Sparkrender's ritual. Initially, 
the kobolds are hostile toward the characters, deter­
mined to scare off the intruders. They are suscepti­
ble to intimidation, though; as an action, a character 
can make a DC 13 Charisma (Intimidation) check, 
convincing them to back down on a success. 
CHAPTER 4 I CLIFFTOP OBSER VAT ORY 
D4: ISOLATED STUDY 
No bridge spans the 22-foot gap between the ro­
tunda and this spire, unless the characters use the 
moonstone key to activate the energy bridge in area 
D2. Characters might come up with any number of 
ingenious ways to cross the gap. See the sidebar 
called "Clever Solutions" for advice to help you de­
termine whether these solutions work. 
The rhythm of the waves below echoes throughout 
this cramped tower. Part of the floor has crumbled 
away, dropping off into a chamber below. Amid the 
rubble, collapsed bookcases jut out at odd angles, and 
moldering books are strewn across the floor. 
Scholar' s]ournal. Though most of the books 
have fallen apart, one tome-a small black journal 
with an ornate lock-remains intact. A character 
who examines the book and succeeds on a DC 15 
Wisdom (Perception) check notices a small arcane 
rune engraved above the keyhole on the journal's 
lock. A character who casts the detect magic spell 
also sees a faint aura around the keyhole. 
This rune is a magical trap that triggers if the 
journal is opened without the use of its original key, 
which is long lost. A character who makes a suc­
cessful DC 11 Intelligence (Arcana) check can deter­
mine how to disarm the trap: by carefully scratching 
over the rune with a dagger, a sharp piece of wire, 
or a similar implement. Once this is done, the jour­
nal can safely be opened either by picking the lock 
with thieves' tools and making a successful DC 10 
Dexterity check, or by breaking the lock with a suc­
cessful DC 12 Strength check. If the lock is opened 
without first disarming the trap, the magic trap 
CLEVER SOL UTIONS 
The challeng es characters face in this advent ure can 
have more than one solution. For example, to reach 
the isolated study (area D4), characters could try any 
of these approaches: 
• Ask the winged kobolds to retrieve the moons tone 
key from area Dl so it can be used again in area D2. 
• Dive or climb down into the water belo w, swim over 
to the other column, and climb back up to the study. 
• Have a character use the misty step spell to cross the 
gap and explore alone. 
Remember , there's more than one way to proceed 
through an adventure, and more than one way to play 
D&D! When ch aracters come up with clever solutions 
to tricky problems, reward them with success-or at 
least a good chance of success. Use the guidelines in 
the "Improvising Ability Checks" section at the start of 
this bookle t to help you. Embrace your players' creativ­
ity, and let them surprise you! 
CHAPTER 4 I CLI FFTOP OBSER VAT ORY spews out noxious green gas, and the character who 
opened the lock takes 3 (ld6) poison damage. 
Inside, the journal contains star maps and notes 
on experiments with magic. One passage is under­
lined near the start of the journal. It reads, in an ar­
chaic dialect of Common, "To ye four scholars: point 
your eyes toward the Dragon's light, for it guides 
your descent into knowledge." This passage is a clue 
to unlocking the hidden entrance in the observatory 
tower (area D5). 
Treasure. A character who searches the tower 
and succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) 
check finds a loose brick in the northwest wall. Pull­
ing the brick out reveals a hidden compartment con­
taining a potion of resistance (lightning; described 
in appendix A) and a pouch holding 10 gp. 
D5: OBSER VATORY TOWER 
Standing taller than the rest of the observatory, the 
main floor of this tower is 45 feet above the ocean's 
surface, which puts it 15 feet above the floor of the 
rotunda (area D2). The kobolds have constructed a 
rough pulley lift so the wingless kobolds can reach 
this area when Sparkrender summons them. 
Rays of light dance across the remains of this tower's 
stained glass dome, making iridescent colors shim­
mer across the crumbled marble walls. Gilded lines 
and jeweled inlays form a detailed star map spanning 
the dusty floor. Four alabaster statues of scholars 
stand around the perimeter of the room, their ex­
pressions worn with time. Each ten-foot-tall statue is 
pointing or gesturing in a different direction. 
Curled in the northeast corner of the tower is a lithe 
blue dragon. Lightning arcs around his horns and 
snout as he slumbers amid a scattered collection of 
coins and glittering jewels. 
Sparkrender the blue dragon wyrmling is currently 
sleeping here, curled up against the northeast wall. 
This presents the characters with an important 
choice: they can waken the dragon and fight him 
now, or they can sneak past the dragon, find a way 
into the secret library below (area D6) and free 
Aidron, and then fight Sparkrender with Aidron's 
help. Either approach is fine. The fight will be easier 
for the characters with Aidron on their side, but they 
can still triumph without Aidron's help. 
You don't need to encourage one course of action 
or the other. Make sure the players realize they have 
a choice, though. You can use Mek and Minn (the 
kobolds from D2) to remind the characters there's 
another dragon around. As you describe the obser­
vatory tower, you can also highlight the caved-in 
wall beneath it (leading to area D6) as a potential 
point of access to the tower. Or you can just tell the 
players they have these two options-plus any oth­
ers they come up with on their own! 
Sneaking Around. If the characters move quietly 
around the area, they can avoid waking Sparkren­
der as long as at least half of them succeed on a DC 
14 Dexterity (Stealth) check. 
If the characters try to turn the statues (see "Hid­
den Entrance" below) without waking Sparkrender, 
have the characters turning the north and east stat­
ues (nearest the sleeping dragon) each make a DC 
14 Dexterity (Stealth) check. On a failed check, the 
noise of a turning statue wakes the dragon. 
Wa king the Dragon. If awakened, Sparkrender is 
hostile toward the characters, growling and barking 
threats in Draconic. Characters who speak Dra­
conic (the paladin and the wizard) can try to con­
vince the dragon not to attack by making a DC 12 
Charisma check and applying the Deception, Intim­
idation, or Persuasion skill as appropriate. A char­
acter who succeeds on the check stops Sparkrender 
from attacking immedia tely, and he instead takes 
the opportunity to boast about his grand ambitions. 
If no character successfully intervenes, or if a char­
acter mentions Aidron or Runara, Sparkrender 
snarls and attacks. 
Despite his youth, Sparkrender is a fearsome foe 
and a loathsome villain. He uses Breath Weapon on 
his first turn and every round it is available thereaf­
ter. (Clever characters can try to use the statues for 
cover from the dragon's breath; see "Cover" in the 
rulebook.) Consider having the wyrmling deliver 
short lines of dialogue on each of his turns, inspired 
by the following examples: 
• "You pests will not stand in my way! I will claim 
the might of my ancestors !" 
• "Get out of here before I tire of this game and 
end you all!" 
• "Chromatic dragons are the rightful rulers of this 
world. Bow down to the children ofTiamat!" 
• "Enough of this! This work is too important to be 
hindered by the likes of you!" 
The dragon fights until reduced to 10 or fewer hit 
points, at which point he swears vengeance against 
the characters and attempts to flee the island start­
ing on his next turn. (He might say something like 
this as he takes the Disengage action and flies away: 
"I swear by Eldenemir the Raging Storm and the 
five heads of Tiamat, you will pay for this insult!") 
If the characters flee, Sparkrender does not pur­
sue them, but he taunts them as they run away. 
(He might say something like, "Yes! Flee before my 
might, as all will flee when I claim my inheritan ce!") 
If the characters defeat Sparkrender, they hear 
growling and yelping coming from below them 
(area D6). Hidden Entrance. Each of the four statues can be 
rotated on its base. To unlock the hidden entrance 
to the observatory's secret archive, each statue must 
be rotated so it points at the constellation called the 
Dragon of Dawn on the floor's star map. 
If the characters found the clue in the isolated 
study (area D4) exhorting "four scholars" to "point 
your eyes toward the Dragon's light," they might 
search the star map for a constellation that looks 
like a dragon. A character who searches the floor 
and succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) 
check finds a constellation resembling a dragon in 
the southeast quadrant of the floor. 
In lieu of that information, a character who 
searches the room for clues and succeeds on a 
DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check notices worn 
grooves in the base of each statue, suggesting the 
statues can turn on their bases. While turning a 
statue, a character can make a DC 10 Wisdom (Per­
ception) check; if the check succeeds, the character 
notices the statue settles slightly when it is pointing 
toward the southeast quadrant of the room and re­
quires extra effort to nudge out of that position. 
Once each statue is in its correct position, a semi­
circular section at the center of the floor begins to 
glow before descending into the library (area D6). 
It forms a spiral staircase leading down to the floor 
of the library. When any statue is rotated out of its 
position, the staircase rises back up, sealing the li­
brary shut once more. (A character on the staircase 
when this happens is lifted up to this area on the 
rising stairs.) 
Treasure. With Sparkrender no longer defending 
his fledgling hoard, characters can gather it up. It 
includes large piles of coins: 4,500 cp, 2,200 sp, 
and 130 gp. There are also ten gems: five pale blue 
quartz crystals worth 10 gp each and five blue jas­
per stones worth 50 gp each. A waterproof leather 
case holds a blue silk fan painted with powdered 
blue gems, worth 25 gp. There are also a few ordi­
nary items Sparkrender enjoyed, including a crude 
flute with a pleasing sound, an hourglass filled with 
sparkling sand, and a set of seven candlesticks. 
D6: SECRET LIBRARY 
This space was formerly a hidden archive of knowl­
edge, accessible only to those who knew the obser­
vatory's secrets. However, the walls of the tower are 
crumbling-a fact that Sparkrender used to trap 
Aidron here. After weakening the bronze wyrmling, 
Sparkrender forced him into the library and then 
caused one of the walls to cave in, sealing the exit. 
If the characters don't use the hidden entrance in 
area D5, they can attempt to clear away the rubble 
from the cave-in to access the secret library. To 
access the rubble, the characters must climb down 
from area D5 or swim to the bottom of this spire 
CHAPTER 4 I CLIFFTOP OBSE RVAT ORY
and climb up from the water. Clearing the rubble 
takes one character 30 minutes, or the characters 
can work together to clear it faster (for example, it 
takes two characters 15 minutes or five characters 
6 minutes). If the characters are trying to clear the 
rubble quietly, it takes twice as long, and at least 
half of the characters must succeed on a DC 14 Dex­
terity (Stealth) check to avoid waking Sparkrender. 
Once they've cleared the rubble, the characters 
can access the library's interior. 
Stale air heavy with the smell of old parchment Aoods 
your nostrils. The walls are lined with shelves stuffed 
full of old tomes and yellowing scrolls. Glass cases, 
toppled over and shattered, have strewn their con­
tents across the stone Aoor. The sound of splintering 
wood echoes through the space, and a moment later 
you see an agitated bronze dragon the size of a bear, 
picking himself up from the wreckage of the old desk 
he apparently crashed into. 
Aidron the bronze dragon wyrmling excitedly 
greets the characters when they enter. He has spent 
days trying to dig his way out through the caved-in 
wall, but his efforts from the inside only caused fur­
ther collapse. He is eager to escape, but if the char­
acters ask, he explains his conflict with Sparkren­
der. He expresses regret over his inability to defeat 
the blue wyrmling and concern for the safety of 
the island's other inhabitants. And he is terrified 
of the fate Sparkrender has in store for him-the 
blue dragon plans to use Aidron's death to claim the 
power of all the dead dragons on the island, trans­
forming himself into a mighty draconic avatar. 
If the characters have not yet defeated Sparkren­
der, Aidron decides to face the blue dragon himself. 
He flies to the top of the observatory tower (area 
D5) to confront Sparkrender once more. However, 
Aidron is too weak to defeat Sparkrender alone; he 
needs the characters' help. 
Once Sparkrender is defeated, the bronze wyrm­
ling is excited to return to Dragon's Rest with the 
characters. 
Treasure. This library was once a repository of 
magical knowledge and items of power, though 
most of its contents are too weathered to read. How­
ever, a character who searches through the room 
and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) 
check finds a +l battlea xe or a spell scroll of hold
pers on (+1 weapons and spell scrolls are both de­
scribed in appendix A). A detect magic spell reveals 
the location of both of these items without requiring 
an ability check. Aidron has also cataloged the con­
tents of the room and can direct the characters to 
these valuable items. 
CHAPTER 4 I CLIFF TOP OBSER VAT ORYSPARKRE NDER'S RITU AL 
If the characters leave the observatory without de­
feating Sparkrender, they might return to find the 
blue wyrmling's ritual underway. This is most likely 
to happen if the characters leave and take a long 
rest before conf ronting Sparkrender , or if they flee 
from combat with Sparkrender and return after 
they've rested. 
Another possibility is that the characters drive 
Sparkrender away from the island without killing 
him, but leave Aidron imprisoned in area D6. In 
this case, Runara urges the characters to return to 
the observatory to find Aidron. When they arrive, 
Sparkrender has also rested, healed, and returned 
to finish his work. 
In either case, the characters arrive just as 
Sparkrender's ritual is getting underway. (If they 
took or destroyed the dragon effigies in area D2, 
they have been replaced by even cruder versions 
created in a hurry.) Read the following text: 
Streams of colored light swirl through the air around 
the golden statue in the ruined rotunda. Each shim­
mering display seems to originate from one of the five 
dragon effigies you saw before, and the lights' colors 
match the color s of the effigies: red, gold, brass, blue, 
and bronze. A blue dragon is perched atop the sculp­
ture, throwing his head back in pain or ecstasy as the 
lights surround him, and he unleashes a bolt of light­
ning up toward the sky. At the base of the statue, a 
bronze dragon is bound to the ground by three heavy 
chains. He looks like he's in agony. 
To stop the ritual, the characters must face 
Sparkrender (blue dragon wyrmling), potentially 
with the help of Aidron (bronze dragon wyrmling), 
if they can free Aidron from his chains (see "Freeing 
Aidron" below). Any surviving kobolds and winged 
kobolds lurk here, but they stay out of combat 
if possible. 
See "Waking the Dragon" in area D5 for ideas 
on how to play Sparkrender in this encounter. He 
uses Breath Weapon as the characters approach 
the scene (unleashing lightning into the sky), so he 
has to wait for this action to recharge before he can 
use it on the characters this time. He fights to the 
death-he has too much riding on the success of 
this ritual to abandon it now. 
Dragon Spirits. At the end of each round of com­
bat (on initiative count 0, after everyone else has 
acted), a random magical effect occurs, caused by 
the magical lights that swirl around the rotunda. 
These lights are manifestations of the dragon spirits 
Sparkrender is trying to bind to himself, but their 
effects are unpredictable. Roll a dlO and consult the 
Dragon Spirits table to see what happens. 
DRAGON SPIRI TS 
dlO Effect 
1-2 Astalagan's Blessing. Aidron and the cha racters 
each regain ld4 + 4 hit points as the bronze light 
surrounds them with warmth. 
3-4 Clyssavar's Flames. Sparkrender must succeed on 
a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or take 7 (2d6) fire 
damage as the golden light crashes into him. 
5-6 Eldenemir's Gift. Sparkrender's Breath Weapon 
recharges as the blue light enfolds him. 
7-8 Sharruth's Fury. Each of the characters must su­
ceed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or take 3 
(ld6) fire damage as the red light erupts with fire. 
9-10 Turadaer's Tricks. Aidron and the characters gain 
advantage on attack rolls and saving throws until 
initiative count 0 of the next round, as the brass 
light shimmers and sparks around them. 
Freeing Aidron. Aidron is bound by three heavy 
chains that keep him restrained. He can still take 
actions, such as biting or clawing an enem y that 
comes within his reach, but he knows Sparkrender 
is unaffected by his lightning Breath Weapon, so he 
doesn't bother using it. He might use his Repulsion 
Breath if he can see a good use for it. 
Large clasps attach the chains to iron rings em­
bedded in the ground. A character can use an action 
to undo one clasp. Once all three clasps are undone, 
Aidron is no longer restrained, though the chains 
reduce his speed by 10 feet. Removing the chains 
from Aidron takes 10 minutes. 
Disrupting the Ritual. The most straightforward 
way to prevent Sparkrender from completing his rit­
ual and obtaining the power he craves is to kill him. 
But characters can also use their actions in combat 
to interfere with the process and hinder Sparkren­
der in magical ways. Let the players try whatever 
they can imagine, using these ideas as examples: 
Manipulate the Effigies. A character might use an 
action to lift an effigy closer to the central sculp­
ture, breathe a prayer to the dragon it represents, 
or otherwise coax magic from it. Doing so imme­
diately triggers the corresponding effect from the 
Dragon Spirits Table. Destroy the Effigies. A character might break an 
effigy or throw it over the crumbling wall and into 
the ocean below. This ensures the corresponding 
effect does not occur again. (Re roll if you get that 
result on the Dragon Spirits table.) 
Manipulate the Sculpture. Characters might try 
to manipulate the golden sculpture as a way of 
disrupting the ritual. The sculpture is large and 
sturdy, though, so a single action has no notice­
able effect on the sculpture or the magic. (The 
sculpture has AC 20, 27 hit points, and immunity 
to poison and psychic damage.) However, disturb­
ing the sculpture does distract Sparkrender. The 
first time a character uses an action to attack or 
otherwise try to disturb the sculpture, the dis­
tracted blue dragon has disadvantage on attack 
rolls and saving throws until the end of his next 
turn. Once he sees the character's meddling 
isn't very effective, he can't be distracted in this 
way again. 
ENDIN G THE AD VENTURE 
With Aidron in tow, the characters can return vic­
torious to Dragon's Rest. Runara is pleased by the 
bronze wyrmling's safe return. As a reward, she 
gives each of the characters a potion of healing and 
an exquisite pearl worth 100 gp. She welcomes 
them to stay at Dragon's Rest as long as they wish 
and furnishes them with whatever supplies they 
need for their travels when they're ready to leave the 
island. If Sparkrender is dead, she grieves the death 
of yet another dragon on Stormwreck Isle, but she 
doesn't condemn the characters for kilting him. 
If your players wish to continue playing their char­
acters, you can use the contents of this set to create 
your own adventures. The "Exploring the Island" 
section of chapter 1 offers additional encounters you 
can use if the characters haven't already faced them. 
Perhaps Sparkrender (or a relative of his) pursues 
the characters in search of revenge, or perhaps 
something uncovered in the secret library leads 
the characters to a distant locale in pursuit of more 
adventure. 
If you want to advance these characters beyond 
3rd level and create adventures for them, you'll need 
the basic rules online or the advanced rulebooks: 
the Player's Handb ook, Dungeon Master's Guide, 
and Monster Manua l.

MA GIC ITEMS 
EVERY ADVENTURE HOLDS THE PROMISE-BUT 
not a guarantee-of finding one or more magic 
items. Dragons of Stormwreck Isle contains an 
assortment of magic items that hints at the wider 
variety of magic items waiting to be found in the 
worlds of D&D. 
USING A MA GIC ITEM 
A magic item's description explains how the item 
works. Handling a magic item is enough to give a 
character a sense that something is extraordinary 
about the item. To learn more, a character can con­
centrate on the item during a short rest, while being 
in physical contact with the item. At the end of the 
rest, the character learns the item's properties. Po­
tions are an exception; a little taste is enough to tell 
the taster what the potion does. 
ITEM DES CRIPTIONS 
These items are in alphabetical order. Under an 
item's name is a line that tells you the type of the 
item, its rarity, and whether you must attune to it. 
BOOTS OF ELVE NKIND 
Wondrous Item, Uncommon 
While you wear these boots, your steps make no 
sound, regardless of the surface you are moving 
across. You also have advantage on Dexterity 
(Stealth ) checks that rely on moving silently. 
ELIXIR OF HEALTH 
Potion, Rare 
When you drink this potion, it cures any disease 
afflicting you, and it removes the blinded, deafened, 
paralyzed, and poisoned conditions. The clear red 
liquid has tiny bubbles of light in it.

When you drink this potion, you gain resistance to 
one type of damage for 1 hour. The DM choose·s 
the type or determines it randomly from the op­
tions below.

SPELL SCR OLL 
Scro ll, Varies dlO Dam age Type 
6 Necrotic 
7 Poison

10 Thunder 
A spell scroll bears the words of a single spell, writ­
ten in a mystical cipher. If the spell is on your class's 
spell list, you can read the scroll and cast its spell 
without providing any material components. Other­
wise, the scroll is unintelligible. Casting the spell by 
reading the scroll requires the spell's normal cast­
ing time. Once the spell is cast, the words on the 
scroll fade, and it crumbles to dust. If the casting is 
interrupted, the scroll is not lost. 
If the spell is on your class's spell list but of a 
higher level than you can normally cast, you must 
make an ability check using your spellcasting ability 
to determine whether you cast it successf ully. The 
DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a success, you 
cast the spell; on a failure, the spell disappears from 
the scroll with no other effect. 
The level of the spell on the scroll determines the 
spell's saving throw DC and attack bonus, as well as 
the scroll's rarity, as shown in the Spell Scroll table.

APPE NDIX B
CREATURES 
Turs APPEN DIX CONTAINS STAT BLOCKS AND SHO RT
descriptions for the creatures that appear in Drag­
ons of Stormwreck Isle. 
. CREATURE STAT BLO CKS 
A creature's stat block provides the essential in­
formation that you, as the DM, need to run it. The 
following sections explain the various pieces of in­
formation you'll find in a stat block. 
SIZE 
A stat block tells you a creature's size: Tiny, Small, 
Medium, Large, Huge, or Gargantuan. Size is ex­
plained in the rulebook. 
SQUEEZING INTO A SMALLER SPACE 
A creature can squeeze through a space large 
enough for a creature one size smaller than itself. 
When a creature is squeezing through such a space, 
its speed is halved, it has disadvantage on attack 
rolls and Dexterity saving throws, and attack rolls 
against it have advantage. 
TYPE 
A creature's type is specified in a stat block, indi­
cating the family of creatures that it belongs to. The 
types in the game are Aberration, Beast, Celestial, 
Construct, Dragon, Elemental, Fey, Fiend, Giant, 
Humanoid, Monstros ity, Ooze, Plant, and Undead. 
ALIG NMEN T 
A creature's alignment reflects its disposition. 
See the rulebook for descriptions of the different 
alignments. 
ARMOR CLASS 
A creature that wears armor or carries a shield has 
an AC that takes its armor, shield, and Dexterity into 
account. Otherwise, a creature's AC is based on its 
Dexterity modifier and any natural armor or super­
natural resilience it might possess. 
If a creature wears armor or carries a shield, the 
kind of armor it wears or shield it carries is noted in 
parentheses after its AC value. 
HIT POINTS 
A stat block specifies a creature's hit point maxi­
mum. In parentheses, the stat block also indicates 
the Hit Dice that were rolled to determined those 
hit points, plus the creature's Constitution modifier 
multiplied by the number of Hit Dice. SPEED 
A creature's speed tells you how far it can move 
on its turn. For more information on speed, see 
the rulebook. 
All creatures have a walking speed; those that 
have no form of ground-based locomotion have a 
walking speed of 0 feet. Some of the creatures in 
this adventure have one or more additional move­
ment modes: 
Burrow. A creature that has a burrowing speed can 
use all or part of its movement to move through 
sand, earth, mud, or ice. It can't burrow through 
solid rock unless it has a special trait that allows 
it to do so. 
Fly. A creature that has a flying speed can use all 
or part of its movement to fly. If the creature is in­
capacitated or knocked prone while flying, it falls 
unless it can hover. 
Swim. A creature that has a swimming speed 
doesn't need to spend extra movement to swim. 
ABIL ITY SCORES 
Every creature has six ability scores (Strength, 
Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and 
Charisma ) and corresponding modifiers. For more 
information on ability scores, see the rulebook. 
SAVING TH ROWS 
The Saving Throws entry is reserved for creatures 
that are proficient in one or more saving throws. 
Saving throws in a stat block are shown with the 
total modifier -the creature's ability modifier plus 
its proficiency bonus. If a creature's stat block says 
"Con +4," roll a d20 and add 4 when the creature 
makes a saving throw using Constitution. 
SKIL LS 
The Skills entry is reserved for creatures that are 
proficient in one or more skills. 
Skills in a stat block are shown with the total mod­
ifier-the creature's ability modifier plus its profi­
ciency bonus. If a creature's stat block says "Stealth 
+4," roll a d20 and add 4 when the creature makes 
an ability check using Stealth. 
VU LNERABI LITI ES, RESI STA NCE S, 
AND IMMUN ITIES 
Some creatures have vulnerabili ty, resistance, or 
immunity to certain types of damage. Additional ly, 
some creatures are immune to certain conditions. 
These immunities are also noted here. 
APP ENDIX B I CREA TURES 
SENSES 
The Senses entry gives a creature's passive Wisdom 
(Perception) score, as well as any special senses the 
creature has, such as the following: 
Blindsight. A creature with blindsight can perceive 
its surroundings without having to rely on sight, 
within a specific radius. 
Darkvision. A creature with darkvision can see in 
dim light within the radius as if it were bright light 
and in darkness as if it were dim light. The crea­
ture discerns color in darkness as shades of gray. 
LANG UAGE S 
The languages that a creature can speak are listed 
in alphabetical order. 
CH ALLE NGE 
A well-rested party of four adventurers should be 
able to defeat a creature that has a challenge rating 
equal to the adventurers' level without any charac­
ters dying. Creatures weaker than 1st-level charac­
ters have challenge ratings lower than 1. 
TRAITS 
In a stat block, traits are special features that ap­
pear right under the creature's Challenge entry. 
AC TIONS 
When a creature takes its action, it can choose from 
the options in the "Actions" section of its stat block 
and the options in the rulebook. 
MELEE AND RANGED ATT ACKS 
The most common actions that a creature takes in 
combat are melee and ranged attacks. See the rule­
book for how attacks work. 
APPENDIX B I CREATURES Any damage or other effects that occur as a result 
of an attack hitting a target are described here. As 
the DM, you can use the average damage or roll the 
damage; for this reason, both the average damage 
and the die expression are presented. For example, 
if a monster deals 4 (ld8) slashing damage with its 
longsword, that notation means you can have the 
monster deal 4 damage, or you can roll ld8 to deter­
mine the damage. 
LIMITED USA GE 
Some special abilities- whether they are traits, ac­
tions, or reactions-have restrictions on the number 
of times they can be used: 
X/Day. The notation "X/Day" means a special abil­
ity can be used a certain number of times, and 
then the creature must finish a long rest to regain 
expended uses. For example, "1/Day" means a 
special ability can be used once, and then the 
creature must finish a long rest to use it again. 
Recharge X-Y. The notation "Recharge X-Y" 
means a creature can use a special ability once, 
and then the ability has a random chance of re­
charging during each subsequent round of com­
bat. At the start of each of the creature's turns, 
roll a d6. If the roll is one of the numbers in the 
recharge notation, the creature regains the use 
of that special ability. The ability also recharges 
when the creature finishes a short or long rest. 
For example, "Recharge 5-6" means a creature 
can use the special ability once. Then, at the start 
of the creature's turn each round, it regains the 
use of the ability if it rolls a 5 or 6 on a d6. 
CREATURE DESCR IPTIONS 
The creatures that appear in the adventure are pre­
sented in this section in alphabetical order. 
DR AGONS 
Dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and 
fearsome power. The oldest dragons, over a thou­
sand years old, are some of the most powerful crea­
tures in the world. Dragons' innate magic fuels their 
dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural 
abilities. 
The chromatic and metallic dragon families en­
compass most of dragonkind. The chromatic drag­
ons-black, blue, green, red, and white-are largely 
selfish, evil, and feared. The metallic dragons­
brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver-are typically 
noble, good, and respected by the wise. 
Though their goals and ideals vary tremendo usly, 
most dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of 
coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. 
Chromatic and metallic dragons pass through four 
distinct stages of life, from wyrmlings to ancient 
dragons. Even wyrmlings in their first five years 
of life are fearsome threats, and wise adventurers 
do not underestimate them or dismiss them as 
"children." BLUE DRAGONS 
Vain and territorial, many blue dragons take plea­
sure in lording their power over creatures they see 
as lesser.

the song must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or 
be charme d until the song ends. The harpy must take a bonus 
action on its subsequent turns to conti nue singi ng. It can stop 
singing at any time. The song ends if the harpy is incapacitated. 
While charme d by the harp y, a target is incapacitated and 
ignores the songs of other harpies. If the charme d target is 
more than 5 feet away from the harpy, the target must move on 
its turn toward the harp y by the most direct route, trying to get 
with in 5 feet. It doesn' t avoid opportun ity attacks, but before 
moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, and when­
ever it takes damag e from a sour ce other than the harpy, the 
target can repeat the saving throw. A char med target can also 
repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If the 
saving throw is successf ul, the effect ends on it. 
A target that succeeds on its saving throw is immune to this 
harpy's song for the next 24 hours.

Adult myconids live and work together in colonies 
and practice a form of communal meditation called 
a meld, in which they seek to transcend mundane

Spore servants are dead creatures reanimated by 
the magical spores of a myconid leader. The final

lapsing into its current comatose state was creating 
a spore servant from a dead giant octopus to protect 
the caves while the leader could not. Unlike a living 
octopus, this guardian has only basic control over 
its tentacles. Rather than coiling around intruders 
to immobilize them, the spore servant simply blud­
geons them.

HIGH ELF 
Elves are a people of otherworldly grace, long-lived and passionate. 
In the earliest days of the multi verse, the first high elves settled in 
fey crossings, places where the natural world and a fantastic realm 
of magic and emotion, known as the Feywild, touch and overlap. The 
high elves mystically took on characteristics blending both realms. 
Your facility with language and your innate understanding of useful 
magic are part of that mystical adaptation . 
As a high elf, you have the following traits. 
Darkvision. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it 
were bright light and in darkness in that radius as if it were dim light. 
You discern colors in that darkness only as shades of gray. 
Fey Ancestry. You have advantage on saving throws you make to 
avoid or end the charmed condition on yourself . 
Trance. Elves don't need to sleep, and magic can't put you to sleep. 
You can finish a long rest in 4 hours if you spend those hours in a 
trancelike meditation, during which you retain consciousn ess. 
Cantrip. Your prestidigitation cantrip (listed above) reflects the 
innate magic of a high elf, not your wizardly study. · 
YOUR SAGE BACKGROUND 
Your parents identified your magical talent early in your long elven life 
and arranged for you to be apprenticed to a kindly wizard in the city of 
Neverwinter. You excelled at your studies and forged friendships and 
rivalries with other apprentices. You always had a particular knack for 
wielding flashy, energetic forces, and you focused your study on the 
school of evocation. 
Your background shaped your character in some important ways. 
A secret sought by a colleague drives you. Your skill proficiencies in 
Arcana and History also reflect your upbringing, studying the nature of 
magic and the great wizards of days past who wielded it. 
After graduating from your apprenticeship, you and your peers 
went your separate ways to focus on your own studies. Recently, you 
received a letter from one of your colleagu es, pointing you toward a 
source of lost knowledge. Shortly <!fter the letter arrived, you learned 
tragic news: your friend died under mysterious circumstances . 
Personal Goal: Discover Lost Knowledge. The lettefr spoke of an 
arcane observatory built on a nearby island by wizards long gone, and 
it hinted at powerful magic hidden there. A small cloister known as 
Dragon's Rest also resides on the island. The caretaker of the cloister's 
temple to the i;iragon god Bahamut, who is a patron of heroes and a 
champion of justice, must have information regarding the observatory . 
This Elder Runara can set you on the path to discovering the knowl­
edge your friend never found.

Adding Spells to Your Spellbook. Each time you gain a wizard 
level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook, 
chosen from the wizard spell list below. Each of these spells must be 
of a level for which you have spell slots. On your adventures, you might 
also find scrolls or books containing other spells you can add to your · 
spell book. 
Copying a Spell into the Book. When you find a wizard spell, you 
can add it to your spell book if it is of a level for which you have spell 
slots and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it. 
For eac·h level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and requires 
50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you 
experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need· 
to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare 
the spell just like your other spells.

YOUR CRIMINAL BAC KGROUND 
You fell in with a thieves' guild called the Gilded Gallows at an early 
age. The guild has prospered in recent years, and its influence is 
spreading across the Sword Coast. You followed that expansion, 
hoping to find your fortune in the city of Neverwinter. 
Your background shaped your character in important ways. You 
learned the use of thieves' tools from scoundrels and gamblers (shown 
in "Proficiencies" on the front of this sheet) and picked up the Goblin 
language at the same time. Your skill proficiencies in Deception and 
Stealth also reflect your upbringing, talking your way out of trouble 
and skulking past unfriendly eyes. 
Fortunes in Neverwinter have been fair but not the fast riches you 
hoped for. You heard a story from a smuggler about a high-ranking 
member of the Gilded Gallows who turned traitor, killed their part­
ner, and fled with a sovereign's ransom in treasure. Thanks to details 
you've picked up here and there that corroborate the story, you're cer­
tain it's more t!fan just a rumor. 
Personal Goal: Find the Lost Fortune. Whoever that Gilder was 
who skipped out with the gold, they've covered their tracks well. The 
trail went cold in Neverwinter, but recently you've learned of a remote 
island cloister called Dragon's Rest. The cloister holds a temple to the 
dragon god Bahamut, who is a patron of heroes and a champion of 
justice. There is also a community of hermits who live there now, the 
perfect place to hide for someone wishing to escape their past. If that 
treasure's there, you'll find it.

perhaps drawing from a real-world culture or a work of literature. 
2. Decide what you look like and determine your character's gender. 
You decide your character's height, weight, age, and coloration (eyes, 
hair, and skin). You can use the art on this page for inspiration or 
choose your own direction. You also might want to give your char­
acter a memorable physical characteristic, such as a scar, a limp, 
spectacles, or a tattoo. You can write notes about your character's 
appearance in the "Notes" space below. 
3. Flesh out your character's personality, and read about your char­
acter's alignment in the rulebook (you may choose a different 
alignment from among the options there). The goal is to choose 
traits and mannerisms for your character that you'll enjoy.

combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or 
Hide action. 
3RD-LEVEL FEATURES 
Second-Story Work. You gain the ability to climb faster than 
normal, so climbing no longer costs you extra movement. In addition,

by a number of feet equal to your Dexterity modifier. 
Fast Hands. You can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning 
Action to make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, take the Use an 
Object action, or use your thieves' tools to try to disarm a trap or open 
a lock. 
Sneak Attack. You deal 2d6 damage with your Sneak Attack, 
instead of ld6.

YOUR NOBLE BACKGROUND 
Your family'is no stranger to wealth, power, and privilege . In the glory 
days of Neverwinter, your parents ruled the county of Corlinn Hill, 
located in the hills northeast of the city. But Mount Hotenow erupted 
thirty years ago, devastating Neverwinter and erasing Corlinn Hill. 
Instead of growing up on an estate, you were raised in a small town­
house in Waterdeep. As an adult, you stand to inherit only a title. 
Your background shaped your character . You learned the languages 
of dwarves and giants from a childhood tutor (shown in "Languages" 
on the front of this sheet), and your skill proficiencies in History and 
Persuasion reflect your education in history and etiquette. 
Since swearing your oath to Bahamut, you've returned to Never­
winter and have been a champion to those who are overlooked by the 
institutions that exist to protect them. Recently, your resolve has been 
shaken by corruption in the city guard and ruling aristocrats. 
Personal Goal: Rejuvenating Pilgrimage. Seeking to reinvigorate 
your resolve, you learned of a remote cloister, Dragon ' s Rest, on a tiny 
island. The cloister holds a temple to the dragon god Bahamut. You 
feel drawn to contemplate your place in the world there.

imbue one weapon that you are holding with positive energy. For 
1 minute, you add +2 to attack rolls made with that weapon. The 
weapon also emits bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for 
20 feet beyond that. If the weapon is not already magical, it becomes 
magical for the duration. You can end this effect on your turn as 
part of any other action. If you are no longer holding or carrying this 
weapon, or if you fall unconscious, this effect ends. 
Turn the Unholy. As an action, you present your holy symbol, and 
each Fiend or Undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you 
must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be turned for 1 
minute or until it takes any damage. A turned creature must spend 
its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't 
willingly ends its move in a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't 
take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to 
escape from an effect that prevents it from moving . If it has nowhere 
it can move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

YOUR FOLK HERO BACKGROUND 
Your parents lived in the prosperous village of Thundertree, east of 
the city of Neverwinter and at the edge of the Neverwinter Wood. But 
when nearby Mount Hotenow erupted thirty years ago, your parents 
fled, perhaps carrying you in your infancy (depending on how old you 
are). Your family drifted from village to village around the region, find­
ing work as laborers where they could. 
Your background shaped your character in important ways. You 
learned the languages of several different peoples (shown in "Lan­
guages" on the front of this sheet). Your skill proficiencies in Animal 
Handling and Survival also reflect your upbringing, working with ani­
mals and getting by in the natural world. 
You've spent the last few years in Neverwinter as a carpenter work- \ 
ing at the city's bustling docks. But it's clear to you and everyone 
around you that you are destined for much more. You stood up to an 
abusive ship captain once, so other dockworkers look up to you. Some­
day, you'll come into your own. You'll be a hero. 
Personal Goal: Determine Your Dest iny. In the remote cloister 
of Dragon's Rest lives an old sage who is supposed to possess great 
wisdom-or possibly supernatural insight. The cloister holds a temple 
to the dragon god Bahamut, who is a patron of heroes and a champion 
of justice. Maybe Elder Runara can help you determine exactly what 
your heroic destiny is and set you on the right path to fulfill it, so you 
can become the hero you know you're meant to be. 
MAKING THE CHARACTER YOURS 
Follow these steps to make this character uniquely yours: 
1. Choose a name and write it in the "Character Name" space on the 
front of this sheet. Your character's name can be anything you like, 
perhaps drawing from a real-world culture or a work of literature. 
2. Decide what you look like and determine your character's gender. 
You decide your character's height, weight, age, and coloration (eyes, 
hair, and skin). You can use the art on this page for inspiration or 
choose your own direction. You also might want to give your char­
acter a memorable physical characteristic, such as a scar, a limp, 
spectacles, or a tattoo. You can write notes about your character's 
appearance in the "Notes" space below. 
3. Flesh out your character's personality , and read about your char­
acter's alignment in the rulebook (you may choose a different 
alignment from among the options there). The goal is to choose 
traits and mannerisms for your character that you'll enjoy. 
GAINING LEVELS 
The DM will tell you when you reach 2nd level and then 3rd level. 
When you reach a new level, you gain the features below for that level.

a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action. 
Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before 
you can use it again.

YOUR SOLDIER BACKGROUND 
You trained as a soldier on the island of Mintarn and joined a mer­
cenary company. You travele d to the city of Neverwinter with your 
company to serve in both the army and city watch. Over time, you grew 
disillusioned with many of your fello w soldiers. They seemed to enjoy 
their authority at the expense of the people they're supposed to protect. 
Your background shaped your character in important ways. You 
learned seyeral languages in the course of your military career (shown 
in "Languages" above). Your skill proficiencies in Athletics and Intimi­
dation reflect your physical training and an ability to overawe foes. 
Recently you've had dreams of a shadow creeping across the sea like 
a shroud, swallowing an island in darkness. Though you dismissed the 
dreams at first, you began to hear a voice calling you to stand against 
death's endless hunger. Certain of your deity's wishes, you resigne d 
your post and set out on your quest. · 
Personal Goal: Banish a Shadow of Death. Researching images 
fro m your dreams pointed you to Stormwreck Isle, not far from Nev­
erwinter. A remote cloister there holds a temple to the dragon god 
Bahamut, who is a patro n of heroes and a champi o n of justice. Some­
one at the cloister may hold the key to the impending doom your deity 
wishes you to avert.
