[ADVENTURE_META]
title: Death House
setting: Village of Barovia, Barovia (Ravenloft/Domains of Dread)
themes: Gothic horror, haunted house, tragic family, cults, supernatural entrapment, illusion vs. reality
tone: Ominous, claustrophobic, mournful, suspenseful, macabre
background.summary: Death House is a sentient, haunted townhouse in Barovia, built by a wealthy family who formed a cult that preyed on visitors and performed dark rituals. After being spurned and then slaughtered by Strahd von Zarovich, the cultists' spirits haunt the dungeons beneath, and the house itself lures new victims to their doom.
story.overview: The adventurers are drawn into Barovia by the mists, encounter the illusory children Rose and Thorn, and are led to Death House under the pretense of rescuing a baby and defeating a monster. The house traps them inside, revealing its haunted nature and cultic horrors as they explore, culminating in a confrontation with the lingering evil below. Escape is only possible after facing the house’s secrets.
recommended_level: 1-3
hooks: The mists of Ravenloft force the characters into Barovia; Rose and Thorn plead for help with a monster in their house; the village is eerily abandoned; the house itself is the only refuge from the encroaching fog.
