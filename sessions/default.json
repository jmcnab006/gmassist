Beyond the trees, a narrow, lonely road stretches eastward, fading into swirling gray mists that pulse with an uneasy silence. The air is damp and chill, filled with the faint scent of damp earth and something faintly metallic.\n\nYour party is an unlikely band of four. Garrick Almsford, a tall human paladin with striking blue eyes and long blonde beard, clad in chainmail, holds his longsword and shield ready, his calm faith steadying the group. Beside him moves Puss N. Boots, a lithe orange-furred Tabaxi rogue with a confident swagger, sporting a turquoise pirate hat adorned with a peacock feather. Tiktik Spellfeather, a brooding raven-like Kenku wizard in dark robes, carefully surveys the shadows with a sharp, cynical gaze. Lastly, Juna, the tall wood-elf barbarian with piercing purple eyes and a fierce stance, grips her great axe, clearly ready to charge headlong into danger."

Gradually, the shadows part to reveal a small, somber village tucked into the folds of the land. The houses rise like dark tombstones, their tall, narrow shapes silhouetted against the heavy gray sky. Wooden shutters are tightly closed, and the streets lie eerily quiet and deserted.\n\nIn the sparse light, two small figures\u2014a pale girl in a simple dress and a wiry boy\u2014stand at the crossroads, their eyes wide and voices tremulous as they whimper softly, beckoning. The pervasive chill seeps into your bones as their presence quietly pulls you deeper into the village."

    "You stand at the edge of a dense, whispering forest where twisted branches claw at a heavy mist settling low over the leaf-strewn ground. Beyond the trees, a narrow, lonely road stretches eastward, fading into swirling gray mists that pulse with an uneasy silence. The air is damp and chill, filled with the faint scent of damp earth and something faintly metallic.\n\nYour party is an unlikely band of four. Garrick Almsford, a tall human paladin with striking blue eyes and long blonde beard, clad in chainmail, holds his longsword and shield ready, his calm faith steadying the group. Beside him moves Puss N. Boots, a lithe orange-furred Tabaxi rogue with a confident swagger, sporting a turquoise pirate hat adorned with a peacock feather. Tiktik Spellfeather, a brooding raven-like Kenku wizard in dark robes, carefully surveys the shadows with a sharp, cynical gaze. Lastly, Juna, the tall wood-elf barbarian with piercing purple eyes and a fierce stance, grips her great axe, clearly ready to charge headlong into danger.",
    "The mist thickens as you follow the lonely road eastward, curling like cold fingers around the tangled trees. Gradually, the shadows part to reveal a small, somber village tucked into the folds of the land. The houses rise like dark tombstones, their tall, narrow shapes silhouetted against the heavy gray sky. Wooden shutters are tightly closed, and the streets lie eerily quiet and deserted.\n\nIn the sparse light, two small figures\u2014a pale girl in a simple dress and a wiry boy\u2014stand at the crossroads, their eyes wide and voices tremulous as they whimper softly, beckoning. The pervasive chill seeps into your bones as their presence quietly pulls you deeper into the village.",
    "The pale girl looks up at Garrick with wide, shining eyes, her voice trembling as she whispers, \"Our home\u2026 it's not safe. They\u2019re coming back, and we need help.\" Her gaze flickers nervously toward the looming dark shapes of the houses behind her, shadows seeming to stretch and twist unnaturally. The boy beside her clutches her hand tightly, his own expression a mix of fear and hope.",
    "The girl's lips quiver with a faint, hopeful smile as she murmurs, \"Thank you\u2026 please come with us.\" The boy nods eagerly, his small hand still gripping hers tightly. The villagers' hollow homes stand silently behind them, the oppressive air thick with unspoken dread, yet the children's fragile trust kindles a flicker of purpose within your group. Together, they begin to lead you down the narrow, mist-cloaked streets deeper into the village.",
    "You follow the pale girl and the wiry boy down the winding, fog-shrouded streets of the village. The cold air carries faint echoes of distant whispers and the scent of damp wood and decaying leaves. The houses loom tall and silent, their dark windows like watchful eyes as the children lead you toward a looming, ominous structure ahead\u2014a house that seems to swallow the wan light around it.",
    "The house towers before you, its dark silhouette etched sharply against the gray sky. Weathered stone and twisted wood create a forbidding facade, with sharp angles and shuttered windows that seem like vacant, watching eyes. The faint scent of decay lingers in the still air, and a rusty wrought-iron gate hangs ajar, its hinges creaking softly in the silence as Garrick steps closer.",
    "As Garrick pushes open the rusty wrought-iron gate, it shrieks aloud, the sound echoing sharply through the heavy silence. The faint scent of dust and decay grows stronger, mingling with the cold air beneath the stone portico, where oil lamps hang dimly from iron chains above the worn flagstone floor. Ahead, a set of mahogany double doors with stained glass panels stands closed, inviting yet foreboding.",
    "Your knuckles rap sharply against the heavy mahogany doors, the sound reverberating through the silent portico. For a long moment, there is only stillness\u2014then, faint shuffling echoes from within, as if something stirs just beyond the stained glass, but no one answers.",
    "The heavy mahogany doors creak open slowly, revealing a grand, dimly lit foyer. Faint dust motes drift in the stale air, settling over polished wood floors and walls adorned with faded Durst family portraits. A cold, musty scent of age and neglect hangs heavily, broken only by the distant, soft creak of floorboards somewhere deeper within the house.",
    "The grand foyer stretches tall, its walls lined with somber portraits of stern-faced figures draped in old-fashioned clothes. Oil lamps hang from iron chains above, casting flickering shadows that dance across the polished wood floor. The air smells faintly of dust and aged wood. To the north, a large doorway with mahogany double doors stained in colored glass leads further inside; to the east, a shadowed corridor disappears into darkness. A faint draft stirs the heavy curtains, whispering from unknown places.",
    "The mahogany double doors with stained glass panels groan softly as they swing open, revealing a wide, elegant hall illuminated by a flickering black marble fireplace. Wood-paneled walls carved with intricate vines, flowers, nymphs, satyrs, and hidden serpents and skulls stretch along the room. A sweeping red marble staircase rises at the far end, its banister worn smooth by time. The air carries a faint chill and the scent of aged stone and polished wood.",
    "Garrick\u2019s eyes scan the spacious hall. Several doors punctuate the wood-paneled walls\u2014some ornate, others plain\u2014each hinting at hidden secrets. The black marble fireplace, topped with a nonmagical longsword mounted above it bearing a delicate windmill cameo, flickers softly, casting dancing shadows that make the intricate carvings seem alive. The red marble staircase sweeps upward elegantly, its polished banister beckoning exploration, though a faint cold draft seems to descend from above, carrying an unsettling hint of the unknown.",
    "The Main Hall spans a wide 30 by 15 feet, its polished wood-paneled walls intricately carved with vines, flowers, nymphs, satyrs, and concealed serpents and skulls that seem to shift in the flickering firelight. A grand black marble fireplace dominates one side, crowned by a nonmagical longsword adorned with a windmill cameo. At the far end, a sweeping red marble staircase rises gracefully, its smooth banister worn by time, while several doors along the walls invite cautious exploration. The air is cool and tinged with the scents of aged stone and polished wood, shadows flickering in the firelight hinting at secrets lurking just out of sight.",
    "Which door does Garrick choose? There are several around the Main Hall\u2014do you want the one to the east, west, or another?",
    "Garrick opens the eastern door, stepping into a small, dimly lit cloakroom. The room is about 5 by 5 feet, with several black cloaks hanging neatly on hooks along the walls and a single top hat resting on a shelf. The air is stale but undisturbed, and the faint creak of the house seems distant here.",
    "Garrick returns through the eastern door, stepping back into the spacious Main Hall where the flickering fireplace casts shifting shadows. Moving toward the north-east corner of the hall, he opens an ornately carved door revealing a tidy kitchen. The room is well-organized, with neatly placed dishware and cookware arranged on shelves and countertops. A stone dome-shaped oven with a bent iron stovepipe dominates one corner, and a wooden worktable holds a cutting board and rolling pin. The faint smell of stale food lingers, hinting at long-unused domestic bustle.",
    "Garrick steps back through the kitchen door, returning to the spacious Main Hall. The flickering fire casts warm, shifting shadows across the polished wood-paneled walls, while the carved vines and hidden serpents seem to watch silently. The cool draft from the staircase drifts softly through the room, inviting further exploration.",
    "The north-west door opens into a wood-paneled room looking like a hunter\u2019s den. Oak walls display a mounted stag head above the fireplace and three stuffed wolves arranged like trophies. Two padded chairs draped with fur face the hearth, while an oak table holds a wine cask, wooden goblets, a pipe rack, and a candelabrum. A chandelier hangs low over a cloth-covered table surrounded by four chairs. Two cabinets stand against the walls\u2014one locked, holding crossbows and bolts; the other unlocked, containing playing cards and wine glasses. The air smells faintly of tobacco and aged wood.",
    "The Den of Wolves is a 20-foot square, oak-paneled room styled as a hunter\u2019s retreat. A stag\u2019s head is mounted above a dark fireplace, while three stuffed wolves, eerily lifelike, are positioned as if lying in wait. Two fur-draped padded chairs face the hearth, and an oak table nearby holds a small wine cask, wooden goblets, a pipe rack, and a candelabrum. Over a cloth-covered table with four chairs hangs a heavy chandelier. Against the walls, two cabinets attract attention\u2014one unlocked and stocked with playing cards and wine glasses, the other securely locked, revealing only a glimpse of weapons within. The air is tinged with the aromas of old tobacco and polished wood.",
    "Garrick steps out of the hunter\u2019s den, returning to the broad, shadow-flickering Main Hall. The cool air and scent of polished wood greet him once again, the soft crackle of flames filling the silence as the house\u2019s carved walls seem to quietly watch his next move.",
    "As Garrick surveys the Main Hall once more, he notes the following doors:\n\n- The door to the east, which led to the small cloakroom.\n- The north-east door, which opened into the tidy kitchen.\n- The north-west door, just explored, leading to the hunter's den.\n- Two additional doors in the south-east and west walls\u2014one near the base of the staircase and another close to the foyer entry.\n\nThe sweeping staircase also beckons, offering a path upward to the next floor. The flickering firelight and shifting shadows hint there may yet be hidden secrets behind the paneling or within the intricate carvings.",
    "Garrick moves to the south-east door and opens it, revealing a warm, wood-paneled dining room. A polished mahogany table, large enough to seat eight, stands beneath a gleaming crystal chandelier. Red silk drapes line the windows, and a marble fireplace supports a fading painting of an alpine valley. A tapestry on one wall shows aristocrats and hunting dogs giving chase to a fleeing wolf, while carved deer and sinister faces peer from the woodwork. Crystalware and silver utensils rest perfectly arranged, but the room is ghostly still.",
    "You step from the dining room into a tidy kitchen, well-organized and filled with the faint aroma of stale food and old wood. Neatly arranged dishware and cookware line the shelves and counters. A stone dome-shaped oven with a bent iron stovepipe rises in one corner, while a wooden worktable holds a cutting board and rolling pin. In the southwest corner, a dumbwaiter sits flush in the wall\u2014a wooden elevator box with a rope and pulley, its bell silent.\n\nA closed door leads to a small pantry on the east wall, and a button on the wall appears to ring the dumbwaiter bell to other floors. The kitchen feels strangely preserved, as if waiting for inhabitants who never returned.",
    "Here are the rooms on the first floor of the house:\n\n- **1A: Portico Entrance** \u2013 Stone portico with wrought-iron gate, leads into foyer.\n- **1B: Grand Foyer** \u2013 Entry hall with portraits and shield, connects to main hall.\n- **2A: Main Hall** \u2013 Wide hall with fireplace, mounted longsword, staircase, carved walls.\n- **2B: Cloakroom** \u2013 Small room with cloaks and top hat.\n- **3: Den of Wolves** \u2013 Hunter\u2019s den with fireplace, stuffed wolves, cabinets with weapons and games.\n- **4A: Kitchen** \u2013 Tidy kitchen with oven, dumbwaiter, worktable, and cookware.\n- **4B: Pantry** \u2013 Small pantry stocked with food.\n- **5: Dining Room** \u2013 Elegant dining room with large table, chandelier, fireplace, tapestry, and fine furnishings.\n\nEach room is connected by doors or hallways, with the main hall (2A) serving as the central hub.",
    "Your party returns to the spacious main hall, the firelight flickering across carved wood-paneled walls. The cool draft grows stronger as you ascend the sweeping red marble staircase, each step creaking faintly beneath your feet.\n\nAt the top, you arrive in a grand upper hall lined with unlit oil lamps. The mantelpiece displays a somber portrait of the Durst family\u2014father, mother, two children, and a baby. Suits of armor with wolf-head visored helms stand silently, clutching spears on either side of the east and west doors. The air here is colder, and a chill draft seems to descend the stairs behind you.",
    "From your vantage in the upper hall, you see several possible exits:\n\n- A door to the east.\n- A door to the west.\n- A door to the northeast (leading to the servants\u2019 room).\n- The marble staircase continues upward to another floor.\n- The stairs you just ascended lead back down to the main hall.\n\nEach doorway is flanked by a silent suit of armor, and the carved paneling along the walls depicts dancing youths, though in the shifting light some seem to be fighting swarms of bats.",
    "You open the door to the east and step into a large library lined with red velvet drapes and tall, mahogany bookshelves packed with hundreds of tomes on history, warfare, alchemy, and fiction. A rolling ladder allows access to the upper shelves. In the center sits a heavy mahogany desk bearing a neatly arranged letter kit\u2014ink, quill, an oil lamp, tinderbox, red wax candle, blank parchment sheets, and a wooden seal carved with the windmill insignia. The soft scent of old parchment and polished wood lingers in the air.",
    "Red velvet drapes cover the windows of this spacious library. Floor-to-ceiling mahogany bookshelves line the south wall, packed with well-worn tomes on history, alchemy, warfare, and fiction. An exquisite mahogany desk and a high-back chair face the entrance and the fireplace, above which hangs a framed picture of a windmill perched atop a rocky crag. Two overstuffed chairs wait in the corners, and a rolling ladder rests against the shelves. The warm scent of old parchment and polished wood fills the air.",
    "As Garrick searches the library, the soft light glints off dust motes floating through the air. He finds the mahogany desk neatly organized\u2014a letter kit with ink, quill, wax candle, parchment, an oil lamp, and a wooden seal carved with the windmill symbol. Rummaging through a drawer, he discovers a small iron key tucked within.\n\nRunning his fingers along the bookshelves, he notices volumes on history, alchemy, and warfare, their spines cracked with age. Some books crumble at the touch, filled with cobwebs and the scent of old parchment. Amid the stacked tomes, a few titles hint at obscure family histories and strange local legends.",
    "Garrick pockets the small iron key from the desk drawer. Its weight is reassuring in his hand, and the windmill insignia stamped into the metal suggests it will unlock something important within the house. The quiet hush of the library remains undisturbed, dust motes swirling slowly in the lamplight.",
    "You stand within the mysterious Death House, having arrived after following the eerie children through the fog-covered village of Barovia. Now inside the upper library, you\u2019ve discovered an iron key likely to unlock a hidden room or secret. Shadows and carved whispers fill the house as you delve deeper into its foreboding secrets, with many hidden doors and passages still to explore\u2014and dangers lurking unseen.",
    "Garrick steps out of the library, returning to the quiet upper hall. The suits of armor stand silently by the doorways, and the cold draft whispers softly around you, as the house seems to watch your every move.",
    "You open the door directly across the hall, stepping into a simple servants\u2019 room. The modest chamber contains two beds with straw-stuffed mattresses and empty footlockers at their feet. The air feels stale, and the faint creak of the house lingers softly. An adjoining closet holds several black servant uniforms hanging neatly on hooks.",
    "The adjoining closet is narrow but orderly, with several black servant uniforms hanging neatly on hooks. The fabrics are faded and dust-covered, hinting at long-forgotten service. No other items or signs of recent use catch your eye amidst the stale air.",
    "You step back through the door, returning to the upper hall where the silent suits of armor and cold drafts await, the house\u2019s eerie stillness pressing quietly around you.",
    "You open the door to the east once more, stepping back into the quiet library. The heavy red velvet drapes and towering bookshelves close around you, the faint scent of old parchment welcoming your return. The soft flicker of lamplight highlights the mahogany desk and scattered tomes, beckoning further exploration.",
    "Garrick\u2019s eyes scan the walls carefully, focusing on the rows of books and the intricate wood paneling. Behind a red-covered fake book on the south wall, just above the bookshelves, a subtle outline suggests a secret door concealed seamlessly within the woodwork\u2014a hidden passage awaits discovery here.",
    "With a careful push, Garrick presses the red-covered fake book, and the concealed door swings open silently, revealing a narrow, dimly lit passage beyond. The faint scent of dust and aged stone drifts from within, hinting at hidden secrets waiting deeper inside.",
    "Yes, Garrick\u2019s keen perception (DC 13) allowed him to notice the subtle outline of the secret door behind the red-covered fake book, revealing the hidden passage when he pressed it.",
    "Garrick succeeded with a Perception check roll of 14, just enough to notice the subtle outline of the secret door behind the red-covered fake book.",
    "Garrick steps cautiously into the cramped secret room, dimly lit and lined with dusty shelves holding ancient tomes bound in faded leather. In one corner rests a heavy wooden chest, half-open with a skeleton slumped against it, dressed in worn leather armor and bearing three poisoned darts stuck in its ribcage. The stale air carries a faint, unsettling chill, as if the room guards long-forgotten secrets.",
    "Garrick kneels beside the skeleton, his fingers tracing the faded leather armor and brittle bones. Despite the decay, he finds a few items of interest: a small, folded letter clutched in one skeletal hand, its paper yellowed but intact; several rusty coins scattered nearby; and three poisoned darts still embedded in the ribcage. The air around the skeleton feels heavy, as if the tragic fate it met still lingers in this hidden chamber.",
    "Garrick carefully unfolds the fragile letter, the aged paper crackling softly. The faded script reveals a terse message signed by Strahd von Zarovich, dismissing the cultists\u2019 efforts and warning of darker powers at play. The letter hints at secret rituals tied to the house and suggests that the cult\u2019s influence here is both ancient and malevolent.",
    "The letter\u2019s faded script reads:\n\n*\"To those who persist in their misguided cult,*\n\n*I, Strahd von Zarovich, declare your efforts futile and your loyalty misplaced. The powers you seek to awaken are beyond your understanding and control. This house and its dark rituals serve only to bind you to a fate worse than death.*\n\n*Cease your machinations, lest you bring ruin not only upon yourselves but upon this cursed land.*\n\n*Strahd von Zarovich\"*",
    "Garrick carefully examines the heavy wooden chest, its surface worn and dust-covered. Inside, he finds three blank black leather-bound books, each with a subtle sheen but no writing within. Nestled among them are three spell scrolls\u2014bless, protection from poison, and spiritual weapon\u2014along with a set of deeds and a signed will bequeathing property to the Durst children. The air carries a faint sense of forgotten power and lingering sorrow.",
    "Garrick gathers the three spell scrolls, the blank black leather-bound books, and the deeds and will from the chest, carefully tucking them away. The weight of these mysterious items in his pack feels heavy with the house's haunted history and promises secrets yet to unfold.",
    "Garrick steps quietly back through the secret door, returning to the dusty library bathed in warm lamplight. The heavy red drapes sway gently in a cold draft, and the scent of old parchment lingers in the air, as the house seems to hold its breath in silent watchfulness.",
    "Garrick steps out of the library, returning to the quiet upper hall. The suits of armor stand silently by the doorways, and the cold draft whispers softly around you, as the house seems to watch your every move.",
    "You open the door to the west and enter the conservatory. The elegant room is draped with gossamer curtains and illuminated by a brass-plated chandelier overhead. Upholstered chairs line the walls, and stained glass hangings depict musicians caught in motion. In one corner, a harpsichord and bench invite quiet music, while a large standing harp stands near the marble fireplace. Alabaster figurines of well-dressed dancers rest on the mantelpiece\u2014some reveal eerie skeletal forms beneath layers of dust. The air is still, the faint scent of old wood and forgotten melodies lingering softly.",
    "As the party searches, the soft creak of floorboards and the faint scent of aged wood fill the still air. The harpsichord and harp look playable but are covered in dust, while the alabaster figurines on the mantelpiece reveal delicate, lifelike carvings beneath their dusty layers. The stained glass windows cast muted, colorful patterns, but nothing else of obvious note or hidden passage stands out amid the gossamer curtains and quiet elegance.",
    "Garrick\u2019s fingers press hesitantly against the dusty keys of the harpsichord, producing a series of uneven, discordant notes that echo awkwardly through the conservatory. The faint sound stirs the still air, but nothing else responds\u2014no hidden mechanism or secret passage reveals itself, just the lingering melancholy of forgotten melodies.",
    "Garrick steps closer to the alabaster figurines on the mantelpiece. The finely carved dancers, though draped in dust, reveal exquisite detail\u2014flowing gowns, delicate poses, and hauntingly lifelike faces. As he inspects more closely, he notices that some figurines\u2019 surfaces hint at brittle, skeletal forms beneath, as if frozen in a strange, eerie dance between life and death.",
