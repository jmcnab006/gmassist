tone: Dark, eerie, suspenseful, atmospheric, foreboding
background.summary: |
  Death House is an ancient, haunted row house in the village of Barovia, repeatedly burned and rebuilt by dark supernatural forces. Originally built by a wealthy family practicing sinister cult rituals, the house became a site of horrific sacrifices and dark magic. The cult sought favor from Strahd von Zarovich, the vampire lord of Barovia, but were rejected and slaughtered. Their spirits haunt the house’s dungeons, and the house itself is alive, intent on luring visitors to their doom. The house has four stories plus a dungeon level, with a sinister history of trapping and devouring wayward visitors. The house repairs itself magically if destroyed, and illusions of two children, Rose and Thorn, serve to lure adventurers inside.
story.overview: |
  The characters are drawn into Strahd’s domain by the mists of Ravenloft and arrive at the village of Barovia. They encounter two ghostly children, Rose and Thorn, who warn of a monster trapped in the house’s basement. The adventurers are compelled to investigate Death House, uncover its dark secrets, and survive its horrors. The house’s malevolent presence seeks to trap and consume them, but by exploring and overcoming the house’s dangers, the characters can escape and advance in level. The adventure is designed to bring 1st-level characters up to 3rd level by accomplishing key milestones.
